## Basics

### Plugins

There are two Gradle plugins:

- `moe-sdk`: this plugin ensures the MOE SDK is installed on the system and exposes the `moe` extension for
accessing its properties.
- `moe`: this plugin does the same as `moe-sdk`, but also adds all the tasks, rules, etc. necessary to build a MOE-based
application.

### Building

Build and publish _release_ version to Maven local repository:

```bash
cd <repo>/moe/tools/master
./gradlew :moe-gradle:publishMavenJavaPublicationToMavenLocal
```

Build and publish _snapshot_ version to Maven local repository:

```bash
cd <repo>/moe/tools/master
./gradlew :moe-gradle:publishMavenJavaSnapshotPublicationToMavenLocal
```

Build and publish _release_ version to Bintray:

```bash
cd <repo>/moe/tools/master
./gradlew :moe-gradle:bintrayUpload \
    -Pbintray.user=user \
    -Pbintray.key=key
```

Build and publish _snapshot_ version to Artifactory:

```bash
cd <repo>/moe/tools/master
./gradlew :moe-gradle:artifactoryPublish \
    -Partifactory.url=url \
    -Partifactory.key=key \
    -Partifactory.user=user \
    -Partifactory.pass=pass
```

### Debugging the Plugin

Before running Gradle, export the following:

```bash
export GRADLE_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005"
```

This way you can remote connect to debug the plugin.

### SDK

The plugin knows which SDK to download, and automatically installs it into the `.moe` directory under the user's home
directory.

The default installation directory can be overridden via the `USER_MOE_HOME` environmental variable.

The plugin's associated SDK is also customizable and is evaluated as follows:

- If there is a path specified via Gradle's project property `moe.sdk.localbuild`, that will be used
- If the `MOE_SDK_LOCALBUILD` environmental variable exists, that will be used
- If the `moe.sdk.localbuild` file in the module, the contents of that file will be used
- Otherwise the default SDK will be downloaded on demand and used

The SDK's structure must be as follows, otherwise the validation will fail:

```
+- sdk
|  +- moe-core.dex
|  +- moe-core.jar
|  +- moe-ios-javadoc.jar
|  +- moe-ios-junit.dex
|  +- moe-ios-junit.jar
|  +- moe-ios-dex.jar
|  +- moe-ios.jar
|  +- iphoneos/MOE.framework
|  \- iphonesimulator/MOE.framework
\- tools
   +- dex2oat
   +- dx.jar
   +- ios-device.jar
   +- java8support.jar
   +- macosx/lib(clang|imobiledevice|natj).dylib
   +- preloaded-classes
   +- proguard-full.cfg
   +- proguard.cfg
   +- proguard.jar
   +- retrolambda.jar
   +- windows/x86_64/(libeay32|libimobiledevice|natj|ssleay32).dll
   \- wrapnatjgen.jar
```

## Configuration

### SDK

You may configure a custom SDK version as follows in the build.gradle file:

```groovy
buildscript {
    project.getExtensions().getExtraProperties().set("moeSDKVersion", 1.3.+)

    ...
}
```

### ProGuard

ProGuard can be configured globally here, or per-config in [ProGuard Task](#proguard-task).

```groovy
moe {
    proguard {
        // apply level
        level = 'platform'
      
        // path to the base configuration file, or `null` to use SDK default config
        baseCfgFile = null
      
        // null or path to to appended configuration file
        appendCfgFile = null
      
        // whether code minification is enabled. Ignored when `baseCfgFile` is specified. Default to `true`
        minifyEnabled = true
      
        // whether code obfuscation is enabled. Ignored when `baseCfgFile` is specified. Default to `false`
        obfuscationEnabled = false

        // exclude files from `-injars` config that will be processed by proguard
        excludeFiles = [
                'META-INF/*.SF',
                'META-INF/*.DSA',
                'META-INF/*.RSA'
        ]
        excludeFile 'org/bouncycastle/jce/provider/*Spi_8.class'
    }
}
```

ProGuard has three supported levels of trimming: `app` (default), `platform`, `all`:
- `app` will only process the classes of your application and it's non-MOE dependencies. This is the fastest mode and
is recommended for development.
- `platform` will do the same as `app` but will also include the `moe-ios.jar` MOE dependency. This mode is a bit
slower and only provides marginally better results.
- `all` will do the same as `platform` but will also include the `moe-core.jar` MOE dependency. This is much slower
than the other two, but will provide the best size reduction.

At any of these levels ProGuard may trim out classes which are needed at compile/runtime. For further configuration
see [ProGuard Task](#proguard-task).

### Xcode Project

Generated Xcode project settings can be configured as follows:

```groovy
moe {
    xcode {
        // Object, path to the Xcode project.
        project
        
        // Object, path to the Xcode workspace.
        workspace

        // String, name of the main target.
        mainTarget

        // String, name of the test target.
        testTarget

        // String, name of the main scheme.
        mainScheme

        // String, name of the test scheme.
        testScheme
    }
}
```

**Note:** when working with Xcode workspaces, scheme settings are required!

### Code Signing

Code signing can be configured by the following options:

```groovy
moe {
    signing {
        // String, ID of the development team.
        developmentTeam

        // String, path to the provisioning profile or UUID.
        provisioningProfile

        // String, name of the provisioning profile (new in Xcode 8).
        provisioningProfileSpecifier

        // String, name of the signing identity
        signingIdentity
    }
}
```

#### Code Signing Defaults

The development team setting can have a default value which can be set in this file:
`<user-home>/.moe/default.properties`.

```text
developmentTeam=ABCDEFGHIJ
```

### Resource Packaging

Resource packaging into the application.jar can be configured in the build script with the following options:

```groovy
moe {
    packaging {
        excludes = ['LICENSE', 'LICENSE.*']
        exclude 'README.md' // Excludes the README.md file from the application.jar
    }
    resources {
        // Enables resources from the source directory
        enableResourcesFromSourceDirs = true

        // Excludes all Java source files when copying from the source directory
        resourcesFromSourceDirExcludes = ['**/*.java']
    }
}
```

### Java Processes

VM arguments for launched Java processes can be customized, for example custom `xmx` values can be set:

```groovy
moe {
    javaProcess {
        jvmArgs '-Xmx4096m'
    }
}
```

### UI Actions and Outlets

Generating Objective-C interfaces can be configured to limit what should be generated. By default all classes marked
with `@ObjCClassName` annotation will be processed.

```groovy
moe {
    actionsAndOutlets {
        // Only include classes matching any regex in this array, setting to empty list resets to default behavior
        includes = ['org\\.moe\\.\\w*Controller']

        // Add include criteria regex to the includes array
        include 'org\\.moe\\.\\w*Controller'
        
        // Additional code to be generated into the Objective-C source
        additionalCodes = ['@class MyObjCOnlyClass;']
        additionalCode '#import "MyClass.h"'
        
        // Disable the generation of specified `@import`'s
        excludeLibraries = ['NotValidImport']
        excludeLibrary 'UIKit'
    }
}
```

## Tasks

### ProGuard Task

Task name: `moe<sourceset><mode>ProGuard`

This task collects the dependent jar files and invokes ProGuard with a set of predefined and (optional) custom rules.
The rules are composed of two parts. The first part comes from the MOE SDK (`<sdk>/tools/proguard.cfg`) which contains
a set of predefined rules. The second part - which is optional - comes from the project's directory
(`<project>/proguard.append.cfg`) and contains a set of additional rules which are appended to the original
configuration. If for some reason the original `proguard.cfg` configuration file is not good for your project then you
can overwrite it by creating a `proguard.cfg` file in your project directory. The result of this task is a
`proguarded.jar` file which contains the minimized version of the application code which is required to run. Detailed
information about what got stripped can be found in the `proguard.log` file which is in your build directory.

#### Task Properties

- `proGuardJar`: path to the `proguard.jar` file.
- `baseCfgFile`: path to the base configuration file.
- `appendCfgFile`: null or path to to appended configuration file.
- `minifyEnabled`: whether code minification is enabled. Ignored when `baseCfgFile` is specified.
- `obfuscationEnabled`: whether code obfuscation is enabled. Ignored when `baseCfgFile` is specified.
- `mappingFile`: path to the name mapping output file. Generated only if `obfuscationEnabled` is `true`.
- `inJars`: collection of paths to files being passed to ProGuard via `-injars`.
- `excludeFiles`: exclude files from `inJars` that will be processed by proguard.
- `libraryJars`: collection of paths to files being passed to ProGuard via `-libraryjars`.
- `outJar`: path to ProGuard's output jar.

- Values for `arch-family`: Arm, Arm64, X86, X86_64

For Android's ART runtime to function we need to provide an art and an oat file which contains application code
information and everything required by the application to be able to run. This task creates those files from the
specified dex file created by the Dex task. The results of this task is an `image.art` file and an `application.oat`
file both of which can be found in the build directory, detailed information about the process can also be found in the
build directory in a file called `dex2oat.log`.

#### Task Properties

Setting any of these properties to null will reset them to their default values.

---

### StartupProvider Task

Task name: `moe<sourceset><mode>StartupProvider`

MOE supports extending Objective-C classes from Java, but there are some special cases where we need to register some
classes even before the Objective-C runtime initializes. These classes must be collected at build time and this task is
responsible for that. The classes it needs to collect are marked with a `@RegisterOnStartup` annotation.
The results of this task is in the `preregister.txt` file which can be found in the build directory and additional
information can also be found there in a file called `StartupProvider.log`.

#### Task Properties

- `inputFiles`: collection of paths to files on which the search for the `@RegisterOnStartup` annotations is conducted.
- `preregisterFile`: path to the output file containing the results.
- `logFile`: path to the task's log file.

Setting any of these properties to null will reset them to their default values.

---

### ResourcePackager Task

Task name: `moe<sourceset><mode>ResourcePackager`

This task collects the resource files used by the application. These files can originate from the application's resource
folder, dependent jars and additional external sources specified in the build script.
The result of this task is an `application.jar` file which can be found in the build directory.

---

### TestClassesProvider Task

Task name: `moe<sourceset><mode>TestClassesProvider`

MOE supports running JUnit tests on iOS devices. This requires a list of classes which contain the JUnit tests. This
task collects these classes and writes them out in a text file.

#### Task Properties

- `inputFiles`: collection of paths to directories and jars. These inputs will be searched for JUnit tests.
- `classListFile`: path to the output file containing the class list.
- `logFile`: path to the task's log file.

Setting any of these properties to null will reset them to their default values.

---

### GenerateUIObjCInterfaces Task

Task name: `moeGenerateUIObjCInterfaces`

#### Task Properties

- `inputFiles`: collection of paths to directories and jars. These inputs will be searched for Objective-C classes.
- `outputSource`: path to the output file containing the class interfaces.
- `xcodeProjectFile`: path to the Xcode project.

Setting any of these properties to null will reset them to their default values.

---

### XcodeProvider Task

Task name: `moe<sourceset><mode><arch><plat>XcodeProvider`

- Values for `mode`: Debug, Release
- Values for `arch`: Armv7, Arm64, I386, X86_64
- Values for `plat`: Iphoneos, Iphonesimulator

This task is responsible for collecting all of the files which are needed by Xcode so it can compile the application
package. This task depends on most of the tasks described above. Also, this task will throw an error if the Xcode
project is not yet updated.

---

### XcodeInternal Task

Task name: `moeXcodeInternal`

This task is only called when the build is initiated from Xcode. If this is the case, Xcode will set a few environmental
variables which this task will try to read and configure the other dependent tasks according to them. This task will
look for the following environmental variables:

- `PLATFORM_NAME`: target platform (iphoneos or iphonesimulator)
- `CONFIGURATION`: target configuration (Debug or Release)
- `ARCHS`: target architectures for the build
- `MOE_BUILD_SOURCE_SET`: source set to build

All of these variables are required, otherwise the task will fail.

### IpaBuild Task

Task name: `moeIpaBuild`

This task creates an ipa from the app.

**Note:** Settings the Ipa export Scheme, Developer Team in the [code signing options](#code-signing) is required!

Ipa export can be configured by the following options:

```groovy
moe {
    ipaExport {

        // (String) Path to the export options plist. If this defined, all other settings ignored
        plistFile

        // (Boolean) For non-App Store exports, should Xcode re-compile the app from bitcode? Defaults to false.
        compileBitcode

        // (Boolean) For non-App Store exports, if the app uses On Demand Resources and this is true,
        // asset packs are embedded in the app bundle so that the app can be tested without a server to host asset
        // packs. Defaults to true unless onDemandResourcesAssetPacksBaseURL is specified.
        embedOnDemandResourcesAssetPacksInBundle

        // (String) For non-App Store exports, if the app is using CloudKit, this configures the
        // "com.apple.developer.icloud-container-environment" entitlement. Available options: Development and Production.
        // Defaults to Development.
        iCloudContainerEnvironment

        // For non-App Store exports, users can download your app over the web by opening your distribution manifest
        // file in a web browser. To generate a distribution manifest, the value of this key should be a dictionary with
        // three sub-keys:

        appURL

        displayImageURL

        fullSizeImageURL

        // (String) Describes how Xcode should export the archive. Available options: app-store, ad-hoc, package,

**Note:** If xcode project use manual signing, provisioningProfileSpecifier is required!

#### Task Properties

- `inputApp`: path to the app to create the ipa from.
- `outputIpa`: path to the output ipa file.

---

### ListDevices Task

Task name: `moeListDevices`

This task lists the UDID's of the connected devices.

---

### ListSimulators Task

Task name: `moeListSimulators`

This task lists the UDID's of the available simulators.

---

### Launch Task

Task name: `moeLaunch`

This task builds and runs the main target of this application on the specified device(s) and/or simulator(s). The
following project properties control this task:

- `-Pmoe.launcher.devices`: comma separated list of device of UDIDs to run the app on.
- `-Pmoe.launcher.simulators`: comma separated list of simulator of UDIDs to run the app on.
- `-Pmoe.launcher.options`: comma separated list of options.
    Options:
    - `config`: overrides the default configuration of release, supported values: debug, release.
    - `no-wait-device`: tells the device launcher not to wait for devices if they're not connected.
    - `no-build`: tells the task not to build the project before launch. This requires an already existing build with
    the correct configuration.
    - `no-launch`: tells the task not to launch the app. This is useful when you only want to build for your target
    devices and want to run as a separate step.
    - `install-on-target`: forces application to be installed on the target device. Mostly used in combination with
    `no-launch`.
    - `no-install-on-target`: skips installation of the application. Mostly used in combination with `no-build`.
    - `debug`: tells the device and simulator launchers to launch with JDWP. Parameters for this option `<local-port>`
    or `<local-port>:<remote-port>`. Remote port only has an effect when launching on devices.
    - `arg`: passes the specified argument to the application.
    - `vmarg`: passes a VM argument to the application.
    - `env`: passes an environmental variable to the application (format: `key=value`).
    - `proxy`: creates a proxy server on the host to the device. Parameters are the same as for `debug`.
    - `raw-test-output`: print all test output to stdout/stderr instead of creating reports.

If neither `-Pmoe.launcher.devices` and `-Pmoe.launcher.simulators` is set, then the task will try to launch on the
first available device.

#### Examples

Build for and launch on the first available device:

```bash
./gradlew moeLaunch
```

Don't build and launch a debug session (with JDWP on port 5005) on simulator:

```bash
./gradlew moeLaunch -Pmoe.launcher.simulators=XXXXXXXXXXXX -Pmoe.launcher.options=no-build,debug:5005
```
