    /**
     * Hint to MPS how much memory your application expects to need for the command buffer
     * <p>
     * This will cause MPS to prefetch a MTLHeap into its internal cache of
     * the indicated size, which will be sub-allocated to back the temporary images,
     * matrices, vectors and states in used over the course of the command buffer.
     * This can be helpful in certain pathological situations when allocation sizes
     * needed to support temporary objects do not allow for reuse of previous allocations
     * for new objects.
     * <p>
     * Example: if the temporary resources need progressively larger MTLHeaps
     * over the course of the MTLCommandBuffer, such as 1 MB, 2MB, 4 MB and 8MB,
     * the first allocation might create a 1 MB heap, this might be released,
     * but since the second allocation needs a 2 MB heap and the 1 MB heap is too
     * small to be used, a new heap would need to be made, and so forth.  Using
     * MPSHintTemporaryMemoryHighWaterMark(), a single 8 MB heap might be made manifest,
     * and all four allocations can use it if they don't overlap temporally. Otherwise,
     * a total of 1+2+4+8=15 MB might be allocated.
     * <p>
     * The application should be careful not to pass the sum of all allocations over
     * the course of the command buffer. As we expect that not all temporary resources
     * need to coexist at the same time, and so can alias one another, that would waste
     * memory. The application should instead track the high water mark of the most
     * memory in use at any single point over the course of the command buffer.
     * <p>
     * This can be simply done by traversing your graph creating all the temporary images,
     * states, matrices and vectors that you will need in advance. Since the allocation of
     * the underlying MTLHeaps that they use is deferred until you actually attempt to write
     * to these resources or get the underlying MTLTexture or MTLBuffer, you can create all
     * the objects, then call MPSHintTemporaryMemoryUsage, then call the various -encode
     * methods and the heap should be sized correctly before memory is distributed to the
     * temporary objects. In this exercise, assume that memory is not distributed to the
     * temporary object until it is used to hold data, and is reclaimed for reuse when readCount
     * reaches zero. The expected size temporary memory used by each object can be queried
     * using its -resourceSize method.
     * <p>
     * Notes: The MPSNNGraph does this automatically for its workload. It is not necessary to
     * prefetch for that. If a MTLHeap large enough to satisfy the size is already cached,
     * no new one will be created. If the prefetched heap turns out to be too small, additional
     * small heaps will be created as needed dynamically. If the prefetched heap is too big,
     * any additional memory is wasted.
     * <p>
     * When the graph is known in advance, this method is preferred over
     * +[MPSTemporaryImage prefetchStorageWithCommandBuffer:imageDescriptorList:]
     * as the latter can not estimate the time period over which each resource is used, and is
     * likely to conservatively prefetch too small a heap.
     *
     * @param cmdBuf The scope of the MTLHeap
     * @param bytes  The size, in bytes, of the prefetched heap. The actual size ussed may be rounded
     *               up according to device alignment requirements. This should be the maximum
     *               `                         amount of temporary memory used at any point in the command buffer.
