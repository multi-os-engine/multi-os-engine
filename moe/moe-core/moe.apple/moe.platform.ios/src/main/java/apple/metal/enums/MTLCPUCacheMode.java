/**
 * [@enum] MTLCPUCacheMode
 * <p>
 * Describes what CPU cache mode is used for the CPU's mapping of a texture resource.
 * [@constant] MTLCPUCacheModeDefaultCache
 * The default cache mode for the system.
 * <p>
 * [@constant] MTLCPUCacheModeWriteCombined
 * Write combined memory is optimized for resources that the CPU will write into, but never read. On some
 * implementations, writes may bypass caches avoiding cache pollution, and reads perform very poorly.
 * <p>
 * Applications should only investigate changing the cache mode if writing to normally cached buffers is known to cause
 * performance issues due to cache pollution, as write combined memory can have surprising performance pitfalls. Another
 * approach is to use non-temporal stores to normally cached memory (STNP on ARMv8, _mm_stream_* on x86_64).
