/**
 * [@enum] AudioFileStreamPropertyFlags
 * [@constant] kAudioFileStreamPropertyFlag_PropertyIsCached
 * This flag is set in a call to AudioFileStream_PropertyListenerProc when the value of the property
 * can be obtained at any later time. If this flag is not set, then you should either get the value of
 * the property from within this callback or set the flag kAudioFileStreamPropertyFlag_CacheProperty in order to signal
 * to the parser to begin caching the property data. Otherwise the value may not be available in the future.
 * <p>
 * [@constant] kAudioFileStreamPropertyFlag_CacheProperty
 * This flag can be set by a property listener in order to signal to the parser that the client is
 * interested in the value of the property and that it should be cached until the full value of the property is
 * available.
