/**
 * [@enum] MTLHeapType
 * <p>
 * Describes the mode of operation for an MTLHeap.
 * [@constant] MTLHeapTypeAutomatic
 * In this mode, resources are placed in the heap automatically.
 * Automatically placed resources have optimal GPU-specific layout, and may perform better than MTLHeapTypePlacement.
 * This heap type is recommended when the heap primarily contains temporary write-often resources.
 * [@constant] MTLHeapTypePlacement
 * In this mode, the app places resources in the heap.
 * Manually placed resources allow the app to control memory usage and heap fragmentation directly.
 * This heap type is recommended when the heap primarily contains persistent write-rarely resources.
