/**
 * AVCaptureStillImageOutput
 * <p>
 * AVCaptureStillImageOutput is a concrete subclass of AVCaptureOutput that can be used to capture high-quality still images with accompanying metadata.
 * <p>
 * Instances of AVCaptureStillImageOutput can be used to capture, on demand, high quality snapshots from a realtime capture source. Clients can request a still image for the current time using the captureStillImageAsynchronouslyFromConnection:completionHandler: method. Clients can also configure still image outputs to produce still images in specific image formats.
