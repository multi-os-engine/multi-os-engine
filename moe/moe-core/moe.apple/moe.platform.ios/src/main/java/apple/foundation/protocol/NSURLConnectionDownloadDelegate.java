/**
 * [@protocol] NSURLConnectionDownloadDelegate
 * <p>
 * Delegate methods used to perform resource
 * downloads directly to a disk file. All the
 * methods are optional with the exception of
 * connectionDidFinishDownloading:destinationURL:
 * which must be implemented in order to inform the
 * delegate of the location of the finished download.
 * This delegate and download implementation is
 * currently only available on iOS 5.0 or later.
 * <p>
 * connection:didWriteData:totalBytesWritten:expectedTotalBytes:
 * provides progress information about the state of
 * the download, the number of bytes written since
 * the last delegate callback, the total number of
 * bytes written to disk and the total number of
 * bytes that are expected (or 0 if this is unknown.)
 * <p>
 * connectionDidResumeDownloading:totalBytesWritten:expectedTotalBytes:
 * is called when the connection is able to resume an
 * in progress download. This may happen due to a
 * connection or network failure.
 * <p>
 * connectionDidFinishDownloading:destinationURL: is
 * a terminal event which indicates the completion of
 * a download and provides the location of the file.
 * The file will be located in the applications cache
 * directory and is guaranteed to exist for the
 * duration of the delegate callback. The
 * implication is that the delegate should copy or
 * move the download to a more persistent location if
 * desired.
