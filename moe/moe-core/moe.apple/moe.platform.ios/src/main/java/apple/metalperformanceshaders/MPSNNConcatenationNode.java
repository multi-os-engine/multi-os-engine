     * image nodes with M, N and O feature channels in them, passed to -initWithSources:

     * image M,  feature channels [M, M+N-1] will be drawn from image N and feature channels

     * <p>
     * As all images are padded out to a multiple of four feature channels,
     * M, N and O here are also multiples of four, even when the MPSImages
     * are not. That is, if the image is 23 feature channels and one channel
     * of padding, it takes up 24 feature channels worth of space in the
     * concatenated result.
     * <p>
     * Performance Note:  Generally, concatenation is free as long as all
     * of the sourceNodes are produced by filters in the same MPSNNGraph.
     * Most MPSCNNKernels have the ability to write their results  at a
     * feature channel offset within a target MPSImage. However, if the
     * MPSNNImageNode source nodes come from images external to the MPSNNGraph,
     * then we have to do a copy operation to assemble the concatenated node.
     * As a result, when deciding where to break a large logical graph into
     * multiple smaller MPSNNGraphs, it is better for concatenations to
     * appear at the ends of subgraphs when possible rather than at the start,
