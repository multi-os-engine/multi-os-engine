/**
 * Images are created with UIImageRenderingModeAutomatic by default. An image with this mode is interpreted as a
 * template image or an original image based on the context in which it is rendered. For example, navigation bars, tab
 * bars, toolbars, and segmented controls automatically treat their foreground images as templates, while image views
 * and web views treat their images as originals. You can use UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysTemplate to force your image to
 * always be rendered as a template or UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal to force your image to always be rendered as
 * an original.
