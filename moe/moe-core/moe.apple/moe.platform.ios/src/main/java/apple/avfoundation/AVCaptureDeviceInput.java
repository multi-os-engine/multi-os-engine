     * portsWithMediaType:sourceDeviceType:sourceDevicePosition:
     * 
     * An accessor method used to retrieve a virtual device's constituent device ports for use in an
     * AVCaptureMultiCamSession.
     * 
     * When using AVCaptureMultiCamSession, multiple devices may be run simultaneously. You may also run simultaneous
     * streams from a virtual device such as the Dual Camera. By inspecting a virtual device's constituentDevices
     * property, you can find its underlying physical devices and, using this method, search for ports originating from
     * one of those constituent devices. Note that the AVCaptureInput.ports array does not include constituent device
     * ports for virtual devices. You must use this accessor method to discover the ports for which you're specifically
     * looking. These constituent device ports may be used to make connections to outputs for use with an
     * AVCaptureMultiCamSession. Using the Dual Camera as an example, the AVCaptureInput.ports property exposes only
     * those ports supported by the virtual device (it switches automatically between wide and telephoto cameras
     * according to the zoom factor). You may use this method to find the video ports for the constituentDevices.
     * 
     * AVCaptureInputPort *wideVideoPort = [dualCameraInput portsWithMediaType:AVMediaTypeVideo
     * sourceDeviceType:AVCaptureDeviceTypeBuiltInWideAngleCamera
     * sourceDevicePosition:AVCaptureDevicePositionBack].firstObject;
     * AVCaptureInputPort *teleVideoPort = [dualCameraInput portsWithMediaType:AVMediaTypeVideo
     * sourceDeviceType:AVCaptureDeviceTypeBuiltInTelephotoCamera
     * sourceDevicePosition:AVCaptureDevicePositionBack].firstObject;
     * 
     * These ports may be used to create connections, say, to two AVCaptureVideoDataOutput instances, allowing for
     * synchronized full frame rate delivery of both wide and telephoto streams.
     * 
     * As of iOS 13, constituent device ports may not be connected to AVCapturePhotoOutput instances. Clients who wish
     * to capture multiple photos from a virtual device should use AVCapturePhotoOutput's
     * virtualDeviceConstituentPhotoDeliveryEnabled feature.
     * 
     * When used in conjunction with an audio device, this method allows you to discover microphones in different
     * AVCaptureDevicePositions. When you intend to work with an AVCaptureMultiCamSession, you may use these ports to
     * make connections and simultaneously capture both front facing and back facing audio simultaneously to two
     * different outputs. When used with an AVCaptureMultiCamSession, the audio device port whose sourceDevicePosition
     * is AVCaptureDevicePositionUnspecified produces omnidirectional sound.
     * 
     * API-Since: 13.0
     * 
     * @param mediaType
     *                             The AVMediaType of the port for which you're searching, or nil if all media types
     *                             should be considered.
     * @param sourceDeviceType
     *                             The AVCaptureDeviceType of the port for which you're searching, or nil if source
     *                             device type is irrelevant.
     * @param sourceDevicePosition
     *                             The AVCaptureDevicePosition of the port for which you're searching.
     *                             AVCaptureDevicePositionUnspecified is germane to audio devices, indicating
     *                             omnidirectional audio. For other types of capture devices (e.g. cameras),
     *                             AVCaptureDevicePositionUnspecified means all positions should be considered in the
     *                             search.
     * 
     * @return
     *         An array of AVCaptureInputPorts satisfying the search criteria, or an empty array could be found.
