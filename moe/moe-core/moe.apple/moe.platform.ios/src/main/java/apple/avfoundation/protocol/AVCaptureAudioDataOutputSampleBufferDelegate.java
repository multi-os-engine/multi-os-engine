     * Delegates receive this message whenever the output captures and outputs new audio samples, decoding or
     * re-encoding as specified by the audioSettings property. Delegates can use the provided sample buffer in
     * conjunction with other APIs for further processing. This method will be called on the dispatch queue specified by
     * the output's sampleBufferCallbackQueue property. This method is called periodically, so it must be efficient to
     * prevent capture performance problems, including dropped audio samples.
     * 
     * Clients that need to reference the CMSampleBuffer object outside of the scope of this method must CFRetain it and
     * then CFRelease it when they are finished with it.

     * @param output
     *                     The AVCaptureAudioDataOutput instance that output the samples.
     * @param sampleBuffer

     *                     such as their format and presentation time.
     * @param connection
     *                     The AVCaptureConnection from which the audio was received.
