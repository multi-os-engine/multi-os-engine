 * [@enum] WKSelectionGranularity
 * <p>
 * The granularity with which a selection can be created and modified interactively.
 * [@constant] WKSelectionGranularityDynamic Selection granularity varies automatically based on the selection.
 * [@constant] WKSelectionGranularityCharacter Selection endpoints can be placed at any character boundary.
 * <p>
 * An example of how granularity may vary when WKSelectionGranularityDynamic is used is
 * that when the selection is within a single block, the granularity may be single character, and when
 * the selection is not confined to a single block, the selection granularity may be single block.
