/**
 * [@enum] AVCaptureSessionInterruptionReason
 * <p>
 * Constants indicating interruption reason. One of these is returned with the
 * AVCaptureSessionWasInterruptedNotification (see AVCaptureSessionInterruptionReasonKey).
 * <p>
 * [@constant] AVCaptureSessionInterruptionReasonVideoDeviceNotAvailableInBackground
 * An interruption caused by the app being sent to the background while using a camera. Camera usage is prohibited while
 * in the background. Beginning in iOS 9.0, AVCaptureSession no longer produces an
 * AVCaptureSessionRuntimeErrorNotification if you attempt to start running a camera while in the background. Instead,
 * it sends an AVCaptureSessionWasInterruptedNotification with
 * AVCaptureSessionInterruptionReasonVideoDeviceNotAvailableInBackground. Provided you don't explicitly call [session
 * stopRunning], your -startRunning request is preserved, and when your app comes back to foreground, you receive
 * AVCaptureSessionInterruptionEndedNotification and your session starts running.
 * [@constant] AVCaptureSessionInterruptionReasonAudioDeviceInUseByAnotherClient
 * An interruption caused by the audio hardware temporarily being made unavailable, for instance, for a phone call, or
 * alarm.
 * [@constant] AVCaptureSessionInterruptionReasonVideoDeviceInUseByAnotherClient
 * An interruption caused by the video device temporarily being made unavailable, for instance, when stolen away by
 * another AVCaptureSession.
 * [@constant] AVCaptureSessionInterruptionReasonVideoDeviceNotAvailableWithMultipleForegroundApps
 * An interruption caused when the app is running in a multi-app layout, causing resource contention and degraded
 * recording quality of service. Given your present AVCaptureSession configuration, the session may only be run if your
 * app occupies the full screen.
 * [@constant] AVCaptureSessionInterruptionReasonVideoDeviceNotAvailableDueToSystemPressure
 * An interruption caused by the video device temporarily being made unavailable due to system pressure, such as thermal
 * duress. See AVCaptureDevice's AVCaptureSystemPressure category for more information.
