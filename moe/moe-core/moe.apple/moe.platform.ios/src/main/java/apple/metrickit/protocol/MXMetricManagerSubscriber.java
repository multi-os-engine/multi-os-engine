 * [@protocol] MXMetricManagerSubscriber
 * 
 * A protocol that allows the conforming object to receive metric payloads from the metric manager.

 * In order to receive metric payloads, atleast one object must conform to this protocol and be subscribed to the metric
 * manager.
 * 
 * Objects which conform to this protocol can be passed to addSubscriber:subscriber and removeSubscriber:subscriber to
 * manage their subscription state.
 * 
 * API-Since: 13.0
