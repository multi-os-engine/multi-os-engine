/**
 * [@enum] MACaptionAppearanceDomain
 * <p>
 * MACaptionAppearanceDomain is used to specify which domain of preferences to access.
 * <p>
 * [@constant] kMACaptionAppearanceDomainUser
 * The user-defined preferences. This domain should be passed to retrieve settings that should be used to render captions.
 * [@constant] kMACaptionAppearanceDomainDefault
 * The system defaults which will not change during a user session. These settings should be used for comparison, not to render captions. For example, when rendering a glyph some caption render engines need to get the user-defined font and the system-defined font to determeine the final pixel size to render a glyph. Most render engines will never need to use this domain.
