/**
 * AVAssetReaderAudioMixOutput
 * 
 * AVAssetReaderAudioMixOutput is a concrete subclass of AVAssetReaderOutput that defines an interface for reading audio
 * samples that result from mixing the audio from one or more AVAssetTracks of an AVAssetReader's AVAsset.
 * 
 * Clients can read the audio data mixed from one or more asset tracks by adding an instance of
 * AVAssetReaderAudioMixOutput to an AVAssetReader using the -[AVAssetReader addOutput:] method.
 * 
 * API-Since: 4.1
