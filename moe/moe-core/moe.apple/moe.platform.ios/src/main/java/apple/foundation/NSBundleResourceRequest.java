/**
 * The NSBundleResourceRequest class is used to interact with the on demand resource loading system.
 * 
 * The purpose of the system is to allow an application to download certain resources on demand, when they are required.
 * This also means that the system can purge a resource from disk when it is no longer required, which will save disk
 * space. This class describes which resources are required, makes the request and reports progress, allows the app to
 * specify how long during its execution that they are required.
 * 
 * Resources are downloaded into the application container, and are made available via the standard NSBundle resource
 * lookup API.
 * 
 * The request object itself is lightweight. You may create as many as you need, for example to request the same set of
 * tags in different components of your application.
 * 
 * API-Since: 9.0

     * NSUserCancelledError in the NSCocoaErrorDomain.
