/**
 * AVCaptureMovieFileOutput
 * <p>
 * AVCaptureMovieFileOutput is a concrete subclass of AVCaptureFileOutput that writes captured media to QuickTime movie files.
 * <p>
 * AVCaptureMovieFileOutput implements the complete file recording interface declared by AVCaptureFileOutput for writing media data to QuickTime movie files. In addition, instances of AVCaptureMovieFileOutput allow clients to configure options specific to the QuickTime file format, including allowing them to write metadata collections to each file, specify media encoding options for each track (Mac OS X), and specify an interval at which movie fragments should be written.

     * <p>
     * Controls whether or not the movie file output will create a timed metadata track that records samples which reflect changes made to the given connection's videoOrientation and videoMirrored properties during recording.
     * <p>
     * When a recording is started the current state of a video capture connection's videoOrientation and videoMirrored properties are used to build the display matrix for the created video track. The movie file format allows only one display matrix per track, which means that any changes made during a recording to the videoOrientation and videoMirrored properties are not captured. For example, a user starts a recording with their device in the portrait orientation, and then partway through the recording changes the device to a landscape orientation. The landscape orientation requires a different display matrix, but only the initial display matrix (the portrait display matrix) is recorded for the video track.
     * <p>
     * By invoking this method the client application directs the movie file output to create an additional track in the captured movie. This track is a timed metadata track that is associated with the video track, and contains one or more samples that contain a Video Orientation value (as defined by EXIF and TIFF specifications, which is enumerated by CGImagePropertyOrientation in <ImageIO/CGImageProperties.h>). The value represents the display matrix corresponding to the AVCaptureConnection's videoOrientation and videoMirrored properties when applied to the input source. The initial sample written to the timed metadata track represents video track's display matrix. During recording additional samples will be written to the timed metadata track whenever the client application changes the video connection's videoOrienation or videoMirrored properties. Using the above example, when the client application detects the user changing the device from portrait to landscape orientation, it updates the video connection's videoOrientation property, thus causing the movie file output to add a new sample to the timed metadata track.
     * <p>
     * After capture, playback and editing applications can use the timed metadata track to enhance their user's experience. For example, when playing back the captured movie, a playback engine can use the samples to adjust the display of the video samples to keep the video properly oriented. Another example is an editing application that uses the sample the sample times to suggest cut points for breaking the captured movie into separate clips, where each clip is properly oriented.
     * <p>
     * The default behavior is to not create the timed metadata track.
