/**
 * [@enum] CTParagraphStyleSpecifier
 * 
 * These constants are used to query and modify the CTParagraphStyle
 * object.
 * 
 * Each specifier has a type and a default value associated with it.
 * The type must always be observed when setting or fetching the
 * value from the CTParagraphStyle object. In addition, some
 * specifiers affect the behavior of both the framesetter and
 * the typesetter, and others only affect the behavior of the
 * framesetter; this is also noted below.
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierAlignment
 * The text alignment. Natural text alignment is realized as
 * left or right alignment, depending on the line sweep direction
 * of the first script contained in the paragraph.
 * 
 * Type: CTTextAlignment
 * Default: kCTTextAlignmentNatural
 * Application: CTFramesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierFirstLineHeadIndent
 * The distance in points from the leading margin of a frame to
 * the beginning of the paragraph's first line. This value is always
 * nonnegative.
 * 
 * Type: CGFloat
 * Default: 0.0
 * Application: CTFramesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierHeadIndent
 * The distance in points from the leading margin of a text
 * container to the beginning of lines other than the first.
 * This value is always nonnegative.
 * 
 * Type: CGFloat
 * Default: 0.0
 * Application: CTFramesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierTailIndent
 * The distance in points from the margin of a frame to the end of
 * lines. If positive, this value is the distance from the leading
 * margin (for example, the left margin in left-to-right text).
 * If 0 or negative, it's the distance from the trailing margin.
 * 
 * Type: CGFloat
 * Default: 0.0
 * Application: CTFramesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierTabStops
 * The CTTextTab objects, sorted by location, that define the tab
 * stops for the paragraph style.
 * 
 * Type: CFArray of CTTextTabRef
 * Default: 12 left-aligned tabs, spaced by 28.0 points
 * Application: CTFramesetter, CTTypesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierDefaultTabInterval
 * The document-wide default tab interval. Tabs after the last
 * specified by kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierTabStops are placed at
 * integer multiples of this distance (if positive).
 * 
 * Type: CGFloat
 * Default: 0.0
 * Application: CTFramesetter, CTTypesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierLineBreakMode
 * The mode that should be used to break lines when laying out
 * the paragraph's text.
 * 
 * Type: CTLineBreakMode
 * Default: kCTLineBreakByWordWrapping
 * Application: CTFramesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierLineHeightMultiple
 * The line height multiple. The natural line height of the
 * receiver is multiplied by this factor (if positive) before
 * being constrained by minimum and maximum line height.
 * 
 * Type: CGFloat
 * Default: 0.0
 * Application: CTFramesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierMaximumLineHeight
 * The maximum height that any line in the frame will occupy,
 * regardless of the font size or size of any attached graphic.
 * Glyphs and graphics exceeding this height will overlap
 * neighboring lines. A maximum height of 0 implies
 * no line height limit. This value is always nonnegative.
 * 
 * Type: CGFloat
 * Default: 0.0
 * Application: CTFramesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierMinimumLineHeight
 * The minimum height that any line in the frame will occupy,
 * regardless of the font size or size of any attached graphic.
 * This value is always nonnegative.
 * 
 * Type: CGFloat
 * Default: 0.0
 * Application: CTFramesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierLineSpacing
 * Deprecated.
 * Use kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierMaximumLineSpacing, kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierMinimumLineSpacing,
 * and kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierLineSpacingAdjustment to control
 * space between lines.
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierParagraphSpacing
 * The space added at the end of the paragraph to separate it from
 * the following paragraph. This value is always nonnegative and is
 * determined by adding the previous paragraph's
 * kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierParagraphSpacing setting and the
 * current paragraph's kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierParagraphSpacingBefore
 * setting.
 * 
 * Type: CGFloat
 * Default: 0.0
 * Application: CTFramesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierParagraphSpacingBefore
 * The distance between the paragraph's top and the beginning of
 * its text content.
 * 
 * Type: CGFloat
 * Default: 0.0
 * Application: CTFramesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierBaseWritingDirection
 * The base writing direction of the lines.
 * 
 * Type: CTWritingDirection
 * Default: kCTWritingDirectionNatural
 * Application: CTFramesetter, CTTypesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierMaximumLineSpacing
 * The maximum space in points between lines within the paragraph
 * (commonly known as leading).
 * 
 * Type: CGFloat
 * Default: some large number.
 * Application: CTFramesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierMinimumLineSpacing
 * The minimum space in points between lines within the paragraph
 * (commonly known as leading).
 * 
 * Type: CGFloat
 * Default: 0.0
 * Application: CTFramesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierLineSpacingAdjustment
 * The space in points added between lines within the paragraph
 * (commonly known as leading).
 * 
 * Type: CGFloat
 * Default: 0.0
 * Application: CTFramesetter
 * 
 * 
 * [@constant] kCTParagraphStyleSpecifierLineBoundsOptions
 * The options controlling the alignment of the line edges with
 * the leading and trailing margins.
 * 
 * Type: CTLineBoundsOptions
 * Default: 0 (no options)
 * Application: CTTypesetter
