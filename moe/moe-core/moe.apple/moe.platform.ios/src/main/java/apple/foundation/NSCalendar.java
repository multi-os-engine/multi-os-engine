     * There will be at least one intervening date which does not match all the components (or the given date itself
     * must not match) between the given date and any result.
     * If the NSCalendarSearchBackwards option is used, this method finds the previous match before the given date. The
     * intent is that the same matches as for a forwards search will be found (that is, if you are enumerating forwards
     * or backwards for each hour with minute "27", the seconds in the date you will get in forwards search would
     * obviously be 00, and the same will be true in a backwards search in order to implement this rule. Similarly for
     * DST backwards jumps which repeats times, you'll get the first match by default, where "first" is defined from the
     * point of view of searching forwards. So, when searching backwards looking for a particular hour, with no minute
     * and second specified, you don't get a minute and second of 59:59 for the matching hour (which would be the
     * nominal first match within a given hour, given the other rules here, when searching backwards).
     * If the NSCalendarMatchStrictly option is used, the algorithm travels as far forward or backward as necessary
     * looking for a match, but there are ultimately implementation-defined limits in how far distant the search will
     * go. If the NSCalendarMatchStrictly option is not specified, the algorithm searches up to the end of the next
     * instance of the next higher unit to the highest specified unit in the NSDateComponents argument. If you want to
     * find the next Feb 29 in the Gregorian calendar, for example, you have to specify the NSCalendarMatchStrictly
     * option to guarantee finding it.
     * If an exact match is not possible, and requested with the NSCalendarMatchStrictly option, nil is passed to the
     * block and the enumeration ends. (Logically, since an exact match searches indefinitely into the future, if no
     * match is found there's no point in continuing the enumeration.)
     * <p>
     * If the NSCalendarMatchStrictly option is NOT used, exactly one option from the set
     * {NSCalendarMatchPreviousTimePreservingSmallerUnits, NSCalendarMatchNextTimePreservingSmallerUnits,
     * NSCalendarMatchNextTime} must be specified, or an illegal argument exception will be thrown.

     * before the end of the next instance of the next higher unit to the highest specified unit in the NSDateComponents
     * argument, the method will return the previous existing value of the missing unit and preserves the lower units'
     * values (e.g., no 2:37am results in 1:37am, if that exists).
     * <p>
     * If the NSCalendarMatchNextTimePreservingSmallerUnits option is specified, and there is no matching time before
     * the end of the next instance of the next higher unit to the highest specified unit in the NSDateComponents
     * argument, the method will return the next existing value of the missing unit and preserves the lower units'

     * If the NSCalendarMatchNextTime option is specified, and there is no matching time before the end of the next
     * instance of the next higher unit to the highest specified unit in the NSDateComponents argument, the method will
     * return the next existing time which exists (e.g., no 2:37am results in 3:00am, if that exists).
     * If the NSCalendarMatchFirst option is specified, and there are two or more matching times (all the components are
     * the same, including isLeapMonth) before the end of the next instance of the next higher unit to the highest
     * specified unit in the NSDateComponents argument, the method will return the first occurrence.
     * If the NSCalendarMatchLast option is specified, and there are two or more matching times (all the components are
     * the same, including isLeapMonth) before the end of the next instance of the next higher unit to the highest
     * specified unit in the NSDateComponents argument, the method will return the last occurrence.
     * If neither the NSCalendarMatchFirst or NSCalendarMatchLast option is specified, the default behavior is to act as
     * if NSCalendarMatchFirst was specified.
     * There is no option to return middle occurrences of more than two occurrences of a matching time, if such exist.
     * <p>
     * Result dates have an integer number of seconds (as if 0 was specified for the nanoseconds property of the
     * NSDateComponents matching parameter), unless a value was set in the nanoseconds property, in which case the
     * result date will have that number of nanoseconds (or as close as possible with floating point numbers).
