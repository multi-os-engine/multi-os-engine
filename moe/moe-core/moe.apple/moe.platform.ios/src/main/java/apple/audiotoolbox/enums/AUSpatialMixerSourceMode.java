/**
 * [@enum] Property values for kAudioUnitProperty_SpatialMixerSourceMode
 * 
 * [@constant] kSpatialMixerSourceMode_SpatializeIfMono
 * 
 * Mono input is spatialized using kAudioUnitProperty_SpatializationAlgorithm.
 * Any input with more than one channel is passed through without spatialization. This is
 * the default mode and corresponds to legacy behavior. The rendering is equivalent to
 * kSpatialMixerSourceMode_PointSource for mono input and
 * kSpatialMixerSourceMode_Bypass for input with more than one channel.
 * 
 * [@constant] kSpatialMixerSourceMode_Bypass
 * 
 * No spatial rendering. If input and output AudioChannelLayouts are equivalent, all
 * input channels are copied to corresponding output channels. If the input and
 * output AudioChannelLayouts differ, mixing is done according to the
 * kAudioFormatProperty_MatrixMixMap property of the layouts. No occlusion, obstruction,
 * or reverb is applied in this mode.
 * 
 * [@constant] kSpatialMixerSourceMode_PointSource
 * 
 * All channels of the input signal are rendered as a single source except if rendering
 * in-head with kSpatialMixerPointSourceInHeadMode_Bypass.
 * 
 * [@constant] kSpatialMixerSourceMode_AmbienceBed
 * 
 * The input channels are spatialized around the listener as far-field sources.
 * The relative directions of the individual channels are specified by the
 * AudioChannelLayout of the bus. The rotation of the whole bed in the global space is
 * controlled by azimuth and elevation parameters.
