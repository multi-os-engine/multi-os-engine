 * [@constant] QUADRATURE_INTEGRATE_QNG
 * Simple non-adaptive automatic integrator using Gauss-Kronrod-Patterson quadrature coefficients.
 * Evaluates 21, or 43, or 87 points in the interval until the requested accuracy is reached.
 * No workspace is necessary for this integrator.
 * <p>
 * [@constant] QUADRATURE_INTEGRATE_QAG
 * Simple globally adaptive integrator.
 * Allows selection of the number of Gauss-Kronrod points used in each subinterval, and the max number of subintervals.
 * <p>
 * [@constant] QUADRATURE_INTEGRATE_QAGS
 * Global adaptive quadrature based on 21-point or 15-point (if at least one bound is infinite) Gaussâ€“Kronrod quadrature within each subinterval, with acceleration by Peter Wynn's epsilon algorithm.
 * If at least one of the interval bounds is infinite, this is equivalent to the QUADPACK QAGI routine. Otherwise, this is equivalent to the QUADPACK QAGS routine.
