/**
 * [@enum] SCNetworkConnectionPPPStatus
 * <p>
 * PPP-specific status of the network connection.
 * This status is returned as part of the extended information
 * for a PPP service.
 * Note: additional status might be returned in the future.
 * Your application should be prepared to receive an unknown value.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPDisconnected
 * PPP is disconnected.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPInitializing
 * PPP is initializing.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPConnectingLink
 * PPP is connecting the lower connection layer (for example,
 * the modem is dialing out).
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPDialOnTraffic
 * PPP is waiting for networking traffic to automatically
 * establish the connection.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPNegotiatingLink
 * The PPP lower layer is connected and PPP is negotiating the
 * link layer (LCP protocol).
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPAuthenticating
 * PPP is authenticating to the server (PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP or
 * EAP protocols).
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPWaitingForCallBack
 * PPP is waiting for the server to call back.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPNegotiatingNetwork
 * PPP is now authenticated and negotiating the networking
 * layer (IPCP or IPv6CP protocols)
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPConnected
 * PPP is now fully connected for at least one networking layer.
 * Additional networking protocol might still be negotiating.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPTerminating
 * PPP networking and link protocols are terminating.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPDisconnectingLink
 * PPP is disconnecting the lower level (for example, the modem
 * is hanging up).
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPHoldingLinkOff
 * PPP is disconnected and maintaining the link temporarily off.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPSuspended
 * PPP is suspended as a result of the suspend command (for
 * example, when a V.92 Modem is On Hold).
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkConnectionPPPWaitingForRedial
 * PPP has found a busy server and is waiting for redial.
