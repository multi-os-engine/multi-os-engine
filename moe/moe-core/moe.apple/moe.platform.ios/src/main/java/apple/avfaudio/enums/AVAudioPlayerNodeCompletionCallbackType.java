/**
 * [@enum] AVAudioPlayerNodeCompletionCallbackType
 * 
 * Specifies when the completion handler must be invoked.
 * 
 * [@constant] AVAudioPlayerNodeCompletionDataConsumed
 * The buffer or file data has been consumed by the player.
 * [@constant] AVAudioPlayerNodeCompletionDataRendered
 * The buffer or file data has been rendered (i.e. output) by the player. This
 * does not account for any signal processing latencies downstream of the player
 * in the engine (see `AVAudioNode(outputPresentationLatency)`).
 * [@constant] AVAudioPlayerNodeCompletionDataPlayedBack
 * Applicable only when the engine is rendering to/from an audio device.
 * The buffer or file has finished playing. This accounts for both (small) signal
 * processing latencies downstream of the player in the engine, as well as
 * (possibly significant) latency in the audio playback device.
 * 
 * API_AVAILABLE(macos(10.13), ios(11.0), watchos(4.0), tvos(11.0));
