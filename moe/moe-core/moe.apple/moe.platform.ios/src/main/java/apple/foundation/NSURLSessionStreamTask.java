/**
 * An NSURLSessionStreamTask provides an interface to perform reads
 * and writes to a TCP/IP stream created via NSURLSession.  This task
 * may be explicitly created from an NSURLSession, or created as a
 * result of the appropriate disposition response to a
 * -URLSession:dataTask:didReceiveResponse: delegate message.
 * <p>
 * NSURLSessionStreamTask can be used to perform asynchronous reads
 * and writes.  Reads and writes are enquened and executed serially,
 * with the completion handler being invoked on the sessions delegate
 * queuee.  If an error occurs, or the task is canceled, all
 * outstanding read and write calls will have their completion
 * handlers invoked with an appropriate error.
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to create NSInputStream and NSOutputStream
 * instances from an NSURLSessionTask by sending
 * -captureStreams to the task.  All outstanding read and writess are
 * completed before the streams are created.  Once the streams are
 * delivered to the session delegate, the task is considered complete
 * and will receive no more messsages.  These streams are
 * disassociated from the underlying session.
