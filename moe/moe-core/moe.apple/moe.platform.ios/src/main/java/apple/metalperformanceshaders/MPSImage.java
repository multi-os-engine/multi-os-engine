/**
 * MPSImage
 * [@dependency] This depends on Metal.framework
 * <p>
 * A MPSImage object describes a MTLTexture that may have more than 4 channels.
 * <p>
 * Some image types, such as those found in convolutional neural networks (CNN)
 * differ from a standard texture in that they may have more than 4 channels
 * per image. While the channels could hold RGBA data, they will more commonly
 * hold a number of structural permutations upon a multi-channel image as the neural
 * network progresses. It is not uncommon for each pixel to have 32 or 64 channels
 * in it.
 * <p>
 * A standard MTLTexture may have no more than 4 channels. The additional
 * channels are stored in slices of 2d texture array (i.e. texture type is MTLTextureType2DArray)
 * such that 4 consecutive channels are stored in each slice of this array.
 * If the number of feature channels is N, number of array slices needed is (N+3)/4.
 * E.g. a CNN image with width 3 and height 2 with 9 channels will be stored as
 * [@code]
 * slice 0   RGBA   RGBA  RGBA
 * RGBA   RGBA  RGBA
 * <p>
 * slice 1      RGBA   RGBA   RGBA
 * RGBA   RGBA   RGBA         (ASCII art /diagonal offset/ intended to show a Z dimension)
 * <p>
 * slice 2         R???   R???   R???
 * R???   R???   R???
 * [@endcode]
 * The width and height of underlying 2d texture array is the same as the width and height of the MPSImage.
 * The array length is equal to (featureChannels + 3) / 4. Channels marked with ? are just
 * for padding and should not contain NaNs or Infs.
 * <p>
 * A MPSImage can be container of multiple CNN images for batch processing. In order to create a
 * MPSImage that contains N images, create MPSImageDescriptor with numberOfImages set to N.
 * <p>
 * Although a MPSImage can contain numberOfImages > 1, the actual number of images among these processed by MPSCNNKernel
 * is controlled by z-dimension of the clipRect. A MPSCNNKernel processes n=clipRect.size.depth images from this collection.
 * The starting source image index to process is given by offset.z. The starting index of the destination image is given by
 * clipRect.origin.z. The MPSCNNKernel takes n=clipRect.size.depth images from tje source at indices [offset.z, offset.z+n],
 * processes each independently and stores the result in the destination at indices [clipRect.origin.z, clipRect.origin.z+n]
 * respectively. Offset.z+n should be <= [src numberOfImage] and clipRect.origin.z+n should be <= [dest numberOfImages] and
 * offset.z must be >= 0.
 * <p>
 * Example: Suppose MPSCNNConvolution takes an input image with 8 channels and outputs an image with 16 channels. The number of
 * slices needed in the source 2d texture array is 2 and the number of slices needed in the destination 2d array is 4. Suppose
 * the source batch size is 5 and destination batch size is 4. (Multiple N-channel images can be processed concurrently in a
 * batch.) The number of source slices will be 2*5=10 and number of destination slices will be 4*4=16. If you want to process
 * just images 2 and 3 of the source and store the result at index 1 and 2 in the destination, you may achieve this by setting
 * offset.z=2, clipRect.origin.z=1 and clipRect.size.depth=2. MPSCNNConvolution will take, in this case, slice 4 and 5 of source and
 * produce slices 4 to 7 of destination. Similarly, slices 6 and 7 will be used to produce slices 8 to 11 of destination.
 * <p>
 * All MPSCNNKernels process images within each batch independently. That is, calling a MPSCNNKernel on an
 * batch is formally the same as calling it on each image in the batch one at a time. However, quite a lot of CPU and GPU overhead
 * will be avoided if batch processing is used. This is especially important for better performance on small images.
 * <p>
 * If the number of feature channels is <= 4 and numberOfImages = 1 i.e. only one slice is needed to represent a MPSImage, the underlying
 * metal texture type will be MTLTextureType2D rather than MTLTextureType2DArray.
 * <p>
 * There are also MPSTemporaryImages, intended for use for very short-lived image data that are produced and consumed
 * immediately in the same MTLCommandBuffer. They are a useful way to minimize CPU-side texture allocation costs and
 * greatly reduce the amount of memory used by your image pipeline.
 * <p>
 * Creation of the underlying texture may in some cases occur lazily.  You should
 * in general avoid calling MPSImage.texture except when unavoidable to avoid
 * materializing memory for longer than necessary. When possible, use the other MPSImage
 * properties to get information about the MPSImage instead.
 * <p>
 * Most MPSImages of 4 or fewer feature channels can generate quicklooks output in
 * Xcode for easy visualization of image data in the object. MPSTemporaryImages can not.
