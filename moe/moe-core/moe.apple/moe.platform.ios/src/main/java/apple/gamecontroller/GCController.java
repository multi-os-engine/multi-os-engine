/**
 * Controllers are available to an application that links to GameController.framework. There are 2 ways to access controllers
 * paired to the system, adopt both to ensure the best user experience:
 * <p>
 * 1: Querying for the the current array or controllers using [GCController controllers].
 * 2: Registering for Connection/Disconnection notifications from NSNotificationCenter.
 * <p>
 * Only controllers that support one of the allowed profiles, such as GCExtendedGamepad, will be enumerated. Check for the profile
 * supported before using a controller in your application. Ignore a controller that doesn't support a profile that suits
 * your application, as the user will expect their controller to either be fully supported or not supported at all.
