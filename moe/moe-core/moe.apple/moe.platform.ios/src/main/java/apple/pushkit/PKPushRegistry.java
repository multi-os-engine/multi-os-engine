/**
 * An object that requests the delivery and handles the receipt of PushKit notifications.
 * 
 * A `PKPushRegistry` object manages only certain types of notifications,
 * such as high-priority notifications needed by a VoIP app. PushKit wakes up your app
 * as needed to deliver incoming notifications and delivers the notifications directly
 * to the push registry object that requested them.
 * 
 * Every time your app launches, whether in the foreground or in the background, create
 * a push registry object and configure it. Typically, you keep the push registry object
 * running for the duration of your app. Each push registry object delivers incoming
 * notifications to its ``PushKit/PKPushRegistry/delegate`` object, which also handles
 * the responses for registration requests. The listing below shows how to create
 * a push registry object and request VoIP notifications. Always assign an appropriate
 * delegate object before modifying the ``PushKit/PKPushRegistry/desiredPushTypes``
 * property.
 * 
 * ```objc
 * - (void) registerForVoIPPushes {
 * self.voipRegistry = [[PKPushRegistry alloc] initWithQueue:nil];
 * self.voipRegistry.delegate = self;
 * 
 * // Initiate registration.
 * self.voipRegistry.desiredPushTypes = [NSSet setWithObject:PKPushTypeVoIP];
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * Assigning a new value to the ``PushKit/PKPushRegistry/desiredPushTypes`` property
 * registers the push registry object with the PushKit servers. The server reports the
 * success or failure of your registration attempts asynchronously to the push registry,
 * which then reports those results to its delegate object. The push registry also delivers
 * all received notifications to the delegate object. For more information about the
 * delegate methods, see ``PushKit/PKPushRegistryDelegate``.
 * 
 * ## Topics
 * 
 * ### Initializing a Push Registry
 * 
 * - ``PushKit/PKPushRegistry/initWithQueue:``
 * 
 * ### Receiving the Notification Data

 * - ``PushKit/PKPushRegistry/delegate``
 * - ``PushKit/PKPushRegistryDelegate``
 * 
 * ### Managing the Push Registry
