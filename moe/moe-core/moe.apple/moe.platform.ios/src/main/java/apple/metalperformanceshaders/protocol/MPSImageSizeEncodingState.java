/**
 * MPSStates conforming to this protocol contain information about a image size elsewhere in the graph
 * <p>
 * In some graphs a sequence of operations are done, then they are undone ins a series of 'reverse'
 * operations. Examples might be pooling vs pooling gradient / upsampling,  or convolution vs. convolution transpose.
 * In such cases, the 'reverse' pass generally is converting from a smaller image to a larger image,
 * and there is insufficient information to do this correctly. Several answers exist and we don't know
 * which is correct.
 * <p>
 * As an example, consider trying to 'undo' integer division with a multiplication. The expression c = a/b
 * is incomplete because there is also a remainder, which may constitute information lost. If we want to
 * reconstitute a based on c and b, we need to use a = c * b + remainder, not just a = c*b.  Similarly, when
 * undoing a downsizing operation, we need the original size to find which answer in the range of
 * a = c*b + [0,b-1] is the right one.
