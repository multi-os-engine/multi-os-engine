/**
 * [@enum]     AVAudioSessionPromptStyle
 * <p>
 * The prompt style is a hint to sessions that use AVAudioSessionModeVoicePrompt to modify the type of
 * prompt they play in response to other audio activity on the system, such as Siri or phone calls.
 * Sessions that issue voice prompts are encouraged to pay attention to changes in the prompt style and
 * modify their prompts in response. Apple encourages the use of non-verbal prompts when the Short
 * style is requested.
 * [@var] AVAudioSessionPromptStyleNone
 * Indicates that another session is actively using microphone input and would be negatively impacted
 * by having prompts play at that time. For example if Siri is recognizing speech, having navigation or
 * exercise prompts play, could interfere with its ability to accurately recognize the userâ€™s speech.
 * Client sessions should refrain from playing any prompts while the prompt style is None.
 * [@var] AVAudioSessionPromptStyleShort
 * Indicates one of three states: Siri is active but not recording, voicemail playback is active, or
 * voice call is active. Short, non-verbal versions of prompts should be used.
 * [@var] AVAudioSessionPromptStyleNormal
 * Indicates that normal (long, verbal) versions of prompts may be used.
