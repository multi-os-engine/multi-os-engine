/**
 * Metadata value type constants.
 * [@typedef] CGImageMetadataType
 * 
 * The XMP type for a CGImageMetadataTag
 * 
 * CGImageMetadataType defines a list of constants used to indicate
 * the type for a CGImageMetadataTag. If you are reading metadata, use the type
 * to determine how to interpret the CGImageMetadataTag's value. If you are
 * creating a CGImageMetadataTag, use the type to specify how the tag
 * should be serialized in XMP. String types have CFStringRef values, array
 * types have CFArray values, and structure types have CFDictionary values.
 * [@const] kCGImageMetadataTypeDefault The type will be interpretted based on the
 * CFType of the tag's value. This is only used when creating a new
 * CGImageMetadataTag - no existing tags should have this value. CFString
 * defaults to kCGImageMetadataTypeString, CFArray defaults to
 * kCGImageMetadataTypeArrayOrdered, and CFDictionary defaults to
 * kCGImageMetadataTypeStructure.
 * [@const] kCGImageMetadataTypeString A string value. CFNumber and CFBoolean
 * values will be converted to a string.
 * [@const] kCGImageMetadataTypeArrayUnordered An array where order does not matter.
 * Serialized in XMP as <rdf:Bag>.
 * [@const] kCGImageMetadataTypeArrayOrdered An array where order is preserved.
 * Serialized in XMP as <rdf:Seq>.
 * [@const] kCGImageMetadataTypeAlternateArray An ordered array where all elements
 * are alternates for the same value. Serialized in XMP as <rdf:Alt>.
 * [@const] kCGImageMetadataTypeAlternateText A special case of an alternate array
 * where all elements are different localized strings for the same value.
 * Serialized in XMP as an alternate array of strings with xml:lang qualifiers.
 * [@const] kCGImageMetadataTypeStructure A collection of keys and values. Unlike
 * array elements, fields of a structure may belong to different namespaces.
