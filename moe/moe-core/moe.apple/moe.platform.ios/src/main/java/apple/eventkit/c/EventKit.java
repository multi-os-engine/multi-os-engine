     * store you are managing. When you receive this notification, you should consider all EKEvent
     * instances you have to be invalid. If you had selected events for a date range using
     * eventsMatchingPredicate, etc. for display, you should release them and re-fetch the events
     * again. If you have an event you are actively using (e.g. you are currently viewing details
     * for it or editing it), you can call [EKEvent refresh] to try to revalidate it against the
     * latest state of the database. If that method returns YES, you can continue to use the event,
     * otherwise, you should release it and abandon what you were doing with it. The view
     * controllers provided by EventKitUI automatically deal with this for you.
     * This notification will also be posted if access to events or reminders is changed by the user.
