/**
 * [@enum]       MessageComposeResult
 * <p>
 * Composition result sent to the delegate upon user completion.
 * <p>
 * This result will inform the client of the user's message composition action.  If the
 * user cancels the composition, <tt>MessageComposeResultCancelled</tt> will be sent to the delegate.
 * Typically <tt>MessageComposeResultSent</tt> will be sent, but <tt>MessageComposeResultFailed</tt> will
 * be sent in the case of failure. </p>Send may only be interpreted as a successful queueing of
 * the message for later sending. The actual send will occur when the device is able to send.
 * [@constant]   MessageComposeResultCancelled   User canceled the composition.
 * [@constant]   MessageComposeResultSent        User successfully sent/queued the message.
 * [@constant]   MessageComposeResultFailed      User's attempt to save or send was unsuccessful.
