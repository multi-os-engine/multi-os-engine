/**
 * [@protocol] AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate
 * <p>
 * A set of delegate callbacks to be implemented by a client who calls AVCapturePhotoOutput's -capturePhotoWithSettings:delegate.
 * <p>
 * AVCapturePhotoOutput invokes the AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate callbacks on a common dispatch queue â€” not necessarily the main queue. While the -captureOutput:willBeginCaptureForResolvedSettings: callback always comes first and the -captureOutput:didFinishCaptureForResolvedSettings: callback always comes last, none of the other callbacks can be assumed to come in any particular order. The AVCaptureResolvedPhotoSettings instance passed to the client with each callback has the same uniqueID as the AVCapturePhotoSettings instance passed in -capturePhotoWithSettings:delegate:. All callbacks are marked optional, but depending on the features you've specified in your AVCapturePhotoSettings, some callbacks become mandatory and are validated in -capturePhotoWithSettings:delegate:. If your delegate does not implement the mandatory callbacks, an NSInvalidArgumentException is thrown.
 * <p>
 * - If you initialize your photo settings with a format dictionary, or use one of the default constructors (that is, if you're not requesting a RAW-only capture), your delegate must respond to either - captureOutput:didFinishProcessingPhoto:error: or the deprecated -captureOutput:didFinishProcessingPhotoSampleBuffer:previewPhotoSampleBuffer:resolvedSettings:bracketSettings:error:. If your delegate responds to both of these callbacks, only the undeprecated variant will be called.
 * - If you initialize your photo settings with a rawPhotoPixelFormatType, your delegate must respond to either -captureOutput:didFinishProcessingPhoto:error: or the deprecated -captureOutput:didFinishProcessingRawPhotoSampleBuffer:previewPhotoSampleBuffer:resolvedSettings:bracketSettings:error:. If your delegate responds to both of these callbacks, only the undeprecated variant will be called.
 * - If you set livePhotoMovieFileURL to non-nil, your delegate must respond to -captureOutput:didFinishProcessingLivePhotoToMovieFileAtURL:duration:photoDisplayTime:resolvedSettings:error:.
 * <p>
 * In the event of an error, all expected callbacks are fired with an appropriate error.
