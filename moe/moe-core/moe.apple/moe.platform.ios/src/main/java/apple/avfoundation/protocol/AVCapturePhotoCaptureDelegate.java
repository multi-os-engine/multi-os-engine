/**
 * [@protocol] AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate
 * 
 * A set of delegate callbacks to be implemented by a client who calls AVCapturePhotoOutput's
 * -capturePhotoWithSettings:delegate.
 * 
 * AVCapturePhotoOutput invokes the AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate callbacks on a common dispatch queue â€” not necessarily
 * the main queue. While the -captureOutput:willBeginCaptureForResolvedSettings: callback always comes first and the
 * -captureOutput:didFinishCaptureForResolvedSettings: callback always comes last, none of the other callbacks can be
 * assumed to come in any particular order. The AVCaptureResolvedPhotoSettings instance passed to the client with each
 * callback has the same uniqueID as the AVCapturePhotoSettings instance passed in -capturePhotoWithSettings:delegate:.
 * All callbacks are marked optional, but depending on the features you've specified in your AVCapturePhotoSettings,
 * some callbacks become mandatory and are validated in -capturePhotoWithSettings:delegate:. If your delegate does not
 * implement the mandatory callbacks, an NSInvalidArgumentException is thrown.
 * 
 * - If you initialize your photo settings with a format dictionary, or use one of the default constructors (that is, if
 * you're not requesting a RAW-only capture), your delegate must respond to either -
 * captureOutput:didFinishProcessingPhoto:error: or the deprecated
 * -captureOutput:didFinishProcessingPhotoSampleBuffer:previewPhotoSampleBuffer:resolvedSettings:bracketSettings:error:.
 * If your delegate responds to both of these callbacks, only the undeprecated variant will be called.
 * - If you initialize your photo settings with a rawPhotoPixelFormatType, your delegate must respond to either
 * -captureOutput:didFinishProcessingPhoto:error: or the deprecated
 * -captureOutput:didFinishProcessingRawPhotoSampleBuffer:previewPhotoSampleBuffer:resolvedSettings:bracketSettings:error:.
 * If your delegate responds to both of these callbacks, only the undeprecated variant will be called.
 * - If you set livePhotoMovieFileURL to non-nil, your delegate must respond to
 * -captureOutput:didFinishProcessingLivePhotoToMovieFileAtURL:duration:photoDisplayTime:resolvedSettings:error:.
 * 
 * In the event of an error, all expected callbacks are fired with an appropriate error.
 * 
 * API-Since: 10.0
