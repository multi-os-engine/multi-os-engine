/**
 * [@enum] VTDecodeFrameFlags
 * <p>
 * Directives for the decompression session and the video decoder, passed into
 * decodeFlags parameter of VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame.
 * <p>
 * [@constant] kVTDecodeFrame_EnableAsynchronousDecompression
 * With the kVTDecodeFrame_EnableAsynchronousDecompression bit clear, the video decoder
 * is compelled to emit every frame before it returns. With the bit set, the decoder may
 * process frames asynchronously, but it is not compelled to do so.
 * [@constant] kVTDecodeFrame_DoNotOutputFrame
 * A hint to the decompression session and video decoder that a CVImageBuffer should not
 * be emitted for this frame. NULL will be returned instead.
 * [@constant] kVTDecodeFrame_1xRealTimePlayback
 * A hint to the video decoder that it would be OK to use a low-power mode that can not decode faster than 1x realtime.
 * [@constant] kVTDecodeFrame_EnableTemporalProcessing
 * With the kVTDecodeFrame_EnableTemporalProcessing bit clear, the video decoder should emit
 * every frame once that frame's decoding is done -- frames may not be delayed indefinitely. With
 * the bit set, it is legal for the decoder to delay frames indefinitely -- at least
 * until VTDecompressionSessionFinishDelayedFrames or VTDecompressionSessionInvalidate is called.
