/**
 * NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousTransitionTypeAccountAdded
 * This value indicates that a new iCloud account is available, and the persistent store in use will / did transition to
 * the new account.
 * It is only possible to discern this state when the application is running, and therefore this transition type will
 * only be posted if the account changes while the application is running or in the background.
 * <p>
 * NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousTransitionTypeAccountRemoved
 * This value indicates that no iCloud account is available, and the persistent store in use will / did transition to
 * the “local” store.
 * It is only possible to discern this state when the application is running, and therefore this transition type will
 * only be posted if the account is removed while the application is running or in the background.
 * <p>
 * NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousTransitionTypeContentRemoved
 * This value indicates that the user has wiped the contents of the iCloud account, usually using Delete All from
 * Documents & Data in Settings. The Core Data integration will transition to an empty store file as a result of this
 * event.
 * <p>
 * NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousTransitionTypeInitialImportCompleted
 * This value indicates that the Core Data integration has finished building a store file that is consistent with the
 * contents of the iCloud account, and is readyto replace the fallback store with that file.
