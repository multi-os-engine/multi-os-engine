/**
 * NLTagger is a class used to automatically tag portions of natural language text with information such as parts of
 * speech, named entities, lemmas, language, and script. An instance of this class is assigned a string to tag, and
 * clients can then obtain tags and ranges for tokens in that string appropriate to a given tag scheme and unit.
 * Predefined tag schemes and tags are defined in NLTagScheme.h. Options arguments of type NLTaggerOptions may include
 * the following flags, which allow clients interested only in certain general types of tokens to specify that tokens of
 * other types should be omitted from the returned results.
