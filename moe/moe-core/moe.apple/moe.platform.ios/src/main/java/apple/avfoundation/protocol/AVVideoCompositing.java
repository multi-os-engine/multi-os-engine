/**
 * [@protocol] AVVideoCompositing
 * <p>
 * Defines properties and methods for custom video compositors
 * <p>
 * For each AVFoundation object of class AVPlayerItem, AVAssetExportSession, AVAssetImageGenerator, or
 * AVAssetReaderVideoCompositionOutput that has a non-nil value for its videoComposition property, when the value of the
 * customVideoCompositorClass property of the AVVideoComposition is not Nil, AVFoundation creates and uses an instance
 * of that custom video compositor class to process the instructions contained in the AVVideoComposition. The custom
 * video compositor instance will be created when you invoke -setVideoComposition: with an instance of
 * AVVideoComposition that's associated with a different custom video compositor class than the object was previously
 * using.
 * <p>
 * When creating instances of custom video compositors, AVFoundation initializes them by calling -init and then makes
 * them available to you for further set-up or communication, if any is needed, as the value of the
 * customVideoCompositor property of the object on which -setVideoComposition: was invoked.
 * <p>
 * Custom video compositor instances will then be retained by the AVFoundation object for as long as the value of its
 * videoComposition property indicates that an instance of the same custom video compositor class should be used, even
 * if the value is changed from one instance of AVVideoComposition to another instance that's associated with the same
 * custom video compositor class.
