Normally, Scribble will focus the target input as soon as the user begins writing, but if you return YES from this callback, it will wait until the user makes a brief pause. This is useful in cases where the text input view will shift or transform when becoming first responder, which can be disruptive to a user trying to handwrite into it.
     * Wherever possible it is preferable to adjust the UI behavior to avoid the layout changes, and only use delayed focus as a last resort, since transcription will happen all at once instead of incrementally.
