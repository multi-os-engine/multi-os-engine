/**
 * The base protocol to which analysis requests conform
 * 
 * An analysis request is a configuration that defines the analysis the client wishes to perform on the audio stream.
 * Each request has a corresponding result type, which contains information describing the analysis results. This
 * protocol is designed for all requests provided by the framework to conform to, and shouldn't be conformed to by
 * client objects.
 * 
 * API-Since: 13.0
