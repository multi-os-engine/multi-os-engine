/**
 * AVAssetReaderOutput
 * <p>
 * AVAssetReaderOutput is an abstract class that defines an interface for reading a single collection of samples of a
 * common media type from an AVAssetReader.
 * <p>
 * Clients can read the media data of an asset by adding one or more concrete instances of AVAssetReaderOutput to an
 * AVAssetReader using the -[AVAssetReader addOutput:] method.
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE NOTE: Make sure to set the alwaysCopiesSampleData property to NO if you do not need to modify
 * the sample data in-place, to avoid unnecessary and inefficient copying.
