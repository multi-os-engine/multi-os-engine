/**
 * [@enum] SCNetworkReachabilityFlags
 * <p>
 * Flags that indicate whether the specified network
 * nodename or address is reachable, whether a connection is
 * required, and whether some user intervention may be required
 * when establishing a connection.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkReachabilityFlagsTransientConnection
 * This flag indicates that the specified nodename or address can
 * be reached via a transient connection, such as PPP.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkReachabilityFlagsReachable
 * This flag indicates that the specified nodename or address can
 * be reached using the current network configuration.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkReachabilityFlagsConnectionRequired
 * This flag indicates that the specified nodename or address can
 * be reached using the current network configuration, but a
 * connection must first be established.
 * <p>
 * As an example, this status would be returned for a dialup
 * connection that was not currently active, but could handle
 * network traffic for the target system.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkReachabilityFlagsConnectionOnTraffic
 * This flag indicates that the specified nodename or address can
 * be reached using the current network configuration, but a
 * connection must first be established.  Any traffic directed
 * to the specified name or address will initiate the connection.
 * <p>
 * Note: this flag was previously named kSCNetworkReachabilityFlagsConnectionAutomatic
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkReachabilityFlagsInterventionRequired
 * This flag indicates that the specified nodename or address can
 * be reached using the current network configuration, but a
 * connection must first be established.  In addition, some
 * form of user intervention will be required to establish this
 * connection, such as providing a password, an authentication
 * token, etc.
 * <p>
 * Note: At the present time, this flag will only be returned
 * in the case where you have a dial-on-traffic configuration
 * (ConnectionOnTraffic), where an attempt to connect has
 * already been made, and where some error (e.g. no dial tone,
 * no answer, bad password, ...) was encountered during the
 * automatic connection attempt.  In this case the PPP controller
 * will stop attempting to establish a connection until the user
 * has intervened.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkReachabilityFlagsConnectionOnDemand
 * This flag indicates that the specified nodename or address can
 * be reached using the current network configuration, but a
 * connection must first be established.
 * The connection will be established "On Demand" by the
 * CFSocketStream APIs.
 * Other APIs will not establish the connection.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkReachabilityFlagsIsLocalAddress
 * This flag indicates that the specified nodename or address
 * is one associated with a network interface on the current
 * system.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkReachabilityFlagsIsDirect
 * This flag indicates that network traffic to the specified
 * nodename or address will not go through a gateway, but is
 * routed directly to one of the interfaces in the system.
 * [@constant] kSCNetworkReachabilityFlagsIsWWAN
 * This flag indicates that the specified nodename or address can
 * be reached via an EDGE, GPRS, or other "cell" connection.
