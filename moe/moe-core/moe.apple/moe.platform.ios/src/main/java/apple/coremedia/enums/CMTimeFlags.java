/**
 * [@enum] CMTimeFlags
 * <p>
 * Flag bits for a CMTime.
 * [@constant] kCMTimeFlags_Valid Must be set, or the CMTime is considered invalid.
 * Allows simple clearing (eg. with calloc or memset) for initialization
 * of arrays of CMTime structs to "invalid". This flag must be set, even
 * if other flags are set as well.
 * [@constant] kCMTimeFlags_HasBeenRounded Set whenever a CMTime value is rounded, or is derived from another rounded
 * CMTime.
 * [@constant] kCMTimeFlags_PositiveInfinity Set if the CMTime is +inf. "Implied value" flag (other struct fields are
 * ignored).
 * [@constant] kCMTimeFlags_NegativeInfinity Set if the CMTime is -inf. "Implied value" flag (other struct fields are
 * ignored).
 * [@constant] kCMTimeFlags_Indefinite Set if the CMTime is indefinite/unknown. Example of usage: duration of a live
 * broadcast.
 * "Implied value" flag (other struct fields are ignored).
