/**
 * AVAssetExportSession
 * <p>
 * An AVAssetExportSession creates a new timed media resource from the contents of an
 * existing AVAsset in the form described by a specified export preset.
 * <p>
 * Prior to initializing an instance of AVAssetExportSession, you can invoke
 * +allExportPresets to obtain the complete list of presets available. Use
 * +exportPresetsCompatibleWithAsset: to obtain a list of presets that are compatible
 * with a specific AVAsset.
 * <p>
 * To configure an export, initialize an AVAssetExportSession with an AVAsset that contains
 * the source media, an AVAssetExportPreset, the output file type, (a UTI string from
 * those defined in AVMediaFormat.h) and the output URL.
 * <p>
 * After configuration is complete, invoke exportAsynchronouslyWithCompletionHandler:
 * to start the export process. This method returns immediately; the export is performed
 * asynchronously. Invoke the -progress method to check on the progress. Note that in
 * some cases, depending on the capabilities of the device, when multiple exports are
 * attempted at the same time some may be queued until others have been completed. When
 * this happens, the status of a queued export will indicate that it's "waiting".
 * <p>
 * Whether the export fails, completes, or is cancelled, the completion handler you
 * supply to -exportAsynchronouslyWithCompletionHandler: will be called. Upon
 * completion, the status property indicates whether the export has completed
 * successfully. If it has failed, the value of the error property supplies additional
 * information about the reason for the failure.
