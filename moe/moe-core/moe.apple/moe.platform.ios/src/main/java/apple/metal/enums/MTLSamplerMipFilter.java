 * [@enum] MTLSamplerMipFilter

 * Options for selecting and filtering between mipmap levels
 * [@constant] MTLSamplerMipFilterNotMipmapped The texture is sampled as if it only had a single mipmap level.  All samples are read from level 0.
 * [@constant] MTLSamplerMipFilterNearest The nearst mipmap level is selected.
 * [@constant] MTLSamplerMipFilterLinear If the filter falls between levels, both levels are sampled, and their results linearly interpolated between levels.
