     * If your app doesn't have permission to access accurate location (see
     * -accuracyAuthorization), you can use this method to request temporary access
     * to accurate location. This access will expire automatically, but it won't expire
     * while the user is still engaged with your app. So, for example, while your app
     * is in the foreground your app will retain the temporary access it was granted.
     * Similarly, if your app starts a Continuous Background Location session with the
     * background location indicator enabled (see -showsBackgroundLocationIndicator),
     * your access to accurate location will remain as long as the background location
     * indicator remains enabled. This allows your app to provide session-oriented
     * experiences which require accurate location (e.g. fitness or navigation), even if
     * the user has decided not to grant your app persistent access to accurate location.
     * 
     * When CoreLocation prepares the prompt for display, it will look at the
     * NSLocationTemporaryUsageDescriptionDictionary key in your Info.plist. The value
     * should be a dictionary containing usage descriptions. The purposeKey you provide
     * to this method must correspond to an entry in that dictionary. To retrieve a
     * localized string, CoreLocation will load your InfoPlist.strings file and try to
     * look up a string using the purposeKey you provided. If that fails, CoreLocation
     * will use the content provided in your Info.plist. For example, suppose your
     * Info.plist contains the following.
     * 
     * <key>NSLocationTemporaryUsageDescriptionDictionary</key>
     * <dict>
     * <key>ExampleUsageDescription</key>
     * <string>This app needs accurate location so it can verify that you're in a supported region.</string>
     * <key>AnotherUsageDescription</key>
     * <string>This app needs accurate location so it can show you relevant results.</string>
     * </dict>
     * 
     * In this case, you would be able to provide either "ExampleUsageDescription" or
     * "AnotherUsageDescription" for the purposeKey argument. Passing any other string
     * would result in the prompt not being displayed. To localize these usage
     * descriptions, you would add entries for "ExampleUsageDescription" and
     * "AnotherUsageDescription" to your InfoPlist.strings file.
     * 
     * CoreLocation may decide against showing the user a prompt. For example, if your
     * app already has access to accurate location or it is currently in the background.
     * When that happens, your completion block will be called with an appropriate
     * NSError. If the user responded to the prompt, your completion block will be
     * called with a nil error. At that point, you may query the state of your
     * CLLocationManager to see if you have been granted accurate access.
     * 
     * The completion block will be called in the same threading context where delegate
     * callbacks occur. That is, it will be called on the runloop where the
     * CLLocationManager was originally initialized.
