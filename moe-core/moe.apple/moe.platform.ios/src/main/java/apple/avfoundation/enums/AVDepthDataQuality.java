/**
 * [@enum] AVDepthDataQuality
 * 
 * Constants indicating the overall quality of depth data map values.
 * 
 * [@constant] AVDepthDataQualityLow
 * The overall quality of values within the map is low (too many invalid depth values).
 * [@constant] AVDepthDataQualityHigh
 * The overall quality of values within the map is high.
 * 
 * Depth data maps are typically generated by comparing images and calculating disparity. If features are lacking in
 * either input image, it may be difficult to find matching keypoints, resulting in a depth data map with substantial
 * holes. These holes can be filled with depth data filtering, but still may produce a map of overall poor quality. If a
 * depth data map suffers from insufficient features, it is marked as low quality, and should be considered a
 * substandard candidate for rendering high-quality depth effects or reconstructing a 3D scene. High quality depth is
 * feature-rich, contains a high level of detail, and should be considered a good candidate for rendering high-quality
 * depth effects or reconstructing a 3D scene.
