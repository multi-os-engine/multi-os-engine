/**
 * [@enum] AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithm
 * 
 * Types of rendering algorithms available per input bus of the environment node
 * 
 * The rendering algorithms differ in terms of quality and cpu cost.
 * AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmEqualPowerPanning is the simplest panning algorithm and also
 * the least expensive computationally.
 * 
 * When rendering to multi-channel hardware, audio data will only be rendered to channels 1 & 2
 * with all rendering algorithms except AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmSoundField and
 * AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmAuto.
 * 
 * AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmEqualPowerPanning
 * EqualPowerPanning merely pans the data of the mixer bus into a stereo field. This
 * algorithm is analogous to the pan knob found on a mixing board channel strip.
 * 
 * AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmSphericalHead
 * SphericalHead is designed to emulate 3 dimensional space in headphones by simulating
 * inter-aural time delays and other spatial cues. SphericalHead is slightly less CPU
 * intensive than the HRTF algorithm.
 * 
 * AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmHRTF
 * HRTF (Head Related Transfer Function) is a high quality algorithm using filtering to
 * emulate 3 dimensional space in headphones. HRTF is a cpu intensive algorithm.
 * 
 * AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmHRTFHQ
 * Higher quality HRTF rendering algorithm compared to AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmHRTF.
 * Improvements have been made to the overall frequency response and localization of
 * sources in a 3D space.
 * 
 * AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmSoundField
 * SoundField is designed for rendering to multi channel hardware. The mixer takes data
 * being rendered with SoundField and distributes it amongst all the output channels with
 * a weighting toward the location in which the sound derives. It is very effective for
 * ambient sounds, which may derive from a specific location in space, yet should be heard
 * through the listener's entire space.
 * 
 * AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmStereoPassThrough
 * StereoPassThrough should be used when no localization is desired for the source data.
 * Setting this algorithm tells the mixer to pass the input channels to output without
 * localization. If the input and output AudioChannelLayouts differ, mixing is done
 * according to the kAudioFormatProperty_MatrixMixMap property of the layouts.
 * 
 * AVAudio3DMixingRenderingAlgorithmAuto
 * Automatically pick the highest-quality rendering algorithm available for current playback
 * hardware. The algorithm may not be identical to other existing algorithms and may change
 * in the future as new algorithms are developed. When using Manual Rendering modes or
 * wired output, it may be necessary to manually set the AVAudioEnvironmentNode's output
 * type. Multi-channel rendering requires setting a channel layout on the
 * AVAudioEnvironmentNode's output.
 *
