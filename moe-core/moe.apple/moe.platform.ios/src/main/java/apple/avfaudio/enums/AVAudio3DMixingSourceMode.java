/**
 * [@enum] AVAudio3DMixingSourceMode
 * 
 * Source types available per input bus of the environment node
 * 
 * The source types differ in how the individual channels of an input bus are distributed
 * in space.
 * 
 * AVAudio3DMixingSourceModeSpatializeIfMono
 * A mono input bus is rendered as a point source at the location of the source node.
 * An input bus with more than one channel is bypassed. This corresponds to legacy
 * behavior and is equivalent to AVAudio3DMixingSourceModePointSource for a mono bus
 * and AVAudio3DMixingSourceModeBypass for a bus with more than one channel.
 * 
 * AVAudio3DMixingSourceModeBypass
 * No spatial rendering. If input and output AudioChannelLayouts are equivalent, all
 * input channels are directly copied to corresponding output channels. If the input and
 * output AudioChannelLayouts differ, mixing is done according to the
 * kAudioFormatProperty_MatrixMixMap property of the layouts. No occlusion, obstruction,
 * or reverb is applied in this mode.
 * 
 * AVAudio3DMixingSourceModePointSource
 * All channels of the bus are rendered as a single source at the location of the source
 * node.
 * 
 * AVAudio3DMixingSourceModeAmbienceBed
 * The input channels are spatialized around the listener as far-field sources anchored to
 * global space. This means that the rendering depends on listener orientation but not on
 * listener position. The directions of the input channels are specified by the
 * AudioChannelLayout of the bus. The rotation of the whole bed in the global space is
 * controlled by the direction of the source node.
 * 
 * API-Since: 13.0
