/**
 * [@enum] AVAudioEngineManualRenderingStatus
 * 
 * Status codes returned from the render call to the engine operating in manual rendering mode.
 * 
 * AVAudioEngineManualRenderingStatusError
 * An error occurred when rendering and no data was returned. See the returned error code
 * for the description of the error.
 * 
 * AVAudioEngineManualRenderingStatusSuccess
 * All of the requested data was returned successfully.
 * 
 * AVAudioEngineManualRenderingStatusInsufficientDataFromInputNode
 * Applicable only to the input node, when it provides input data for rendering
 * (see `AVAudioInputNode(setManualRenderingInputPCMFormat:inputBlock:)`).
 * Indicates that not enough input data was returned by the input node to satisfy the
 * render request at the current time. The output buffer may contain data rendered by other
 * active sources in the engine's processing graph.
 * 
 * AVAudioEngineManualRenderingStatusCannotDoInCurrentContext
 * The operation could not be performed now, but the client could retry later if needed.
 * This is usually to guard a realtime render operation (e.g. rendering through
 * `manualRenderingBlock`) when a reconfiguration of the engine's internal state
 * is in progress.
 * 
 * API-Since: 11.0
