/**
 * Database of focus decisions with methods to change them.
 * Knows what has been detected in each frame and which detection is being focused on.
 * All operations are executed in a thread-safe manner, but that also means that a long-running update can stall a
 * lookup.
 * Best practice is to lookup what you need up front (outside your critical code) and pass the immutable results to
 * where it's needed.
 * That way, you're not blocked when you access the information, say inside the rendering portion of your code.
