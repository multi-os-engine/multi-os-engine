/**
 * The exact formatted result for these date and time styles depends on the
 * locale, but generally:
 * Short is completely numeric, such as "12/13/52" or "3:30pm"
 * Medium is longer, such as "Jan 12, 1952"
 * Long is longer, such as "January 12, 1952" or "3:30:32pm"
 * Full is pretty complete; e.g. "Tuesday, April 12, 1952 AD" or "3:30:42pm PST"
 * The specifications though are left fuzzy, in part simply because a user's
 * preference choices may affect the output, and also the results may change
 * from one OS release to another. To produce an exactly formatted date you
 * should not rely on styles and localization, but set the format string and
 * use nothing but numbers.
