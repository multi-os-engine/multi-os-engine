/**
 * [@enum] CMTimeRoundingMethod
 * 
 * Rounding method to use when computing time.value during timescale conversions.
 * [@constant] kCMTimeRoundingMethod_RoundHalfAwayFromZero Round towards zero if abs(fraction) is < 0.5,
 * away from 0 if abs(fraction) is >= 0.5.
 * [@constant] kCMTimeRoundingMethod_Default Synonym for kCMTimeRoundingMethod_RoundHalfAwayFromZero.
 * [@constant] kCMTimeRoundingMethod_RoundTowardZero Round towards zero if fraction is != 0.
 * [@constant] kCMTimeRoundingMethod_RoundAwayFromZero Round away from zero if abs(fraction) is > 0.
 * [@constant] kCMTimeRoundingMethod_QuickTime Use kCMTimeRoundingMethod_RoundTowardZero if converting
 * from larger to smaller scale (ie. from more precision to
 * less precision), but use
 * kCMTimeRoundingMethod_RoundAwayFromZero if converting
 * from smaller to larger scale (ie. from less precision to
 * more precision). Also, never round a negative number down
 * to 0; always return the smallest magnitude negative
 * CMTime in this case (-1/newTimescale).
 * [@constant] kCMTimeRoundingMethod_RoundTowardPositiveInfinity Round towards +inf if fraction is != 0.
 * [@constant] kCMTimeRoundingMethod_RoundTowardNegativeInfinity Round towards -inf if fraction is != 0.
 * 
 * API-Since: 4.0
