     * for each filter can be tedious and complicated work, so this method
     * is made available to automate the process. The application may
     * modify the properties of the descriptor before a MPSImage is made from
     * it, so long as the choice is sensible for the kernel in question.
     * Please see individual kernel descriptions for restrictions.
     * 
     * The expected timeline for use is as follows:
     * 
     * 1) This method is called:
     * a) The default MPS padding calculation is applied. It
     * uses the MPSNNPaddingMethod of the .padding property to
     * provide a consistent addressing scheme over the graph.
     * It creates the MPSImageDescriptor and adjusts the .offset
     * property of the MPSNNKernel. When using a MPSNNGraph, the
     * padding is set using the MPSNNFilterNode as a proxy.
     * 
     * b) This method may be overridden by MPSCNNBinaryKernel subclass
     * to achieve any customization appropriate to the object type.
     * 
     * c) Source states are then applied in order. These may modify the
     * descriptor and may update other object properties. See:
     * -destinationImageDescriptorForSourceImages:sourceStates:
     * forKernel:suggestedDescriptor: This is the typical way
     * in which MPS may attempt to influence the operation of
     * its kernels.
     * 
     * d) If the .padding property has a custom padding policy method
     * of the same name, it is called. Similarly, it may also adjust
     * the descriptor and any MPSCNNBinaryKernel properties. This is the
     * typical way in which your application may attempt to influence
     * the operation of the MPS kernels.
     * 
     * 2) A result is returned from this method and the caller
     * may further adjust the descriptor and kernel properties
     * directly.
     * 
     * 3) The caller uses the descriptor to make a new MPSImage to
     * use as the destination image for the -encode call in step 5.
     * 
     * 4) The caller calls -resultStateForSourceImage:sourceStates:destinationImage:
     * to make any result states needed for the kernel. If there isn't
     * one, it will return nil. A variant is available to return a
     * temporary state instead.
     * 
     * 5) a -encode method is called to encode the kernel.
     * 
     * The entire process 1-5 is more simply achieved by just calling an -encode...
     * method that returns a MPSImage out the left hand sid of the method. Simpler
     * still, use the MPSNNGraph to coordinate the entire process from end to end.
     * Opportunities to influence the process are of course reduced, as (2) is no longer
     * possible with either method. Your application may opt to use the five step method
     * if it requires greater customization as described, or if it would like to estimate
     * storage in advance based on the sum of MPSImageDescriptors before processing
     * a graph. Storage estimation is done by using the MPSImageDescriptor to create
     * a MPSImage (without passing it a texture), and then call -resourceSize. As long
     * as the MPSImage is not used in an encode call and the .texture property is not
     * invoked, the underlying MTLTexture is not created.
     * 
     * No destination state or destination image is provided as an argument to this
     * function because it is expected they will be made / configured after this
     * is called. This method is expected to auto-configure important object properties
     * that may be needed in the ensuing destination image and state creation steps.
     * 
     * @param sourceImages A array of source images that will be passed into the -encode call
     *                     Since MPSCNNBinaryKernel is a binary kernel, it is an array of length 2.
     * @param sourceStates An optional array of source states that will be passed into the -encode call

     * 
     * A graph may need to allocate storage up front before executing. This may be
     * necessary to avoid using too much memory and to manage large batches. The function
     * should allocate any MPSState objects that will be produced by an -encode call
     * with the indicated sourceImages and sourceStates inputs. Though the states
     * can be further adjusted in the ensuing -encode call, the states should
     * be initialized with all important data and all MTLResource storage allocated.
     * The data stored in the MTLResource need not be initialized, unless the ensuing
     * -encode call expects it to be.
     * 
     * The MTLDevice used by the result is derived from the command buffer.
     * The padding policy will be applied to the filter before this is called
     * to give it the chance to configure any properties like MPSCNNKernel.offset.
     * 
     * CAUTION: the result state should be made after the kernel properties are
     * configured for the -encode call that will write to the state, and
     * after -destinationImageDescriptorForSourceImages:sourceStates:
     * is called (if it is called). Otherwise, behavior is undefined.
     * Please see the description of
     * -[MPSCNNKernel resultStateForSourceImage:sourceStates:destinationImage] for more.
     * 
     * Default: returns nil
     * 
     * @param commandBuffer  The command buffer to allocate the temporary storage against
     *                       The state will only be valid on this command buffer.
     * @param primaryImage   The MPSImage consumed by the associated -encode call.
     * @param secondaryImage The MPSImage consumed by the associated -encode call.
     * @param sourceStates   The list of MPSStates consumed by the associated -encode call,
     *                       for a batch size of 1.
     * @return The list of states produced by the -encode call for batch size of 1.
     *         When the batch size is not 1, this function will be called repeatedly unless
     *         -isResultStateReusedAcrossBatch returns YES. If -isResultStateReusedAcrossBatch
     *         returns YES, then it will be called once per batch and the MPSStateBatch array will
     *         contain MPSStateBatch.length references to the same object.
