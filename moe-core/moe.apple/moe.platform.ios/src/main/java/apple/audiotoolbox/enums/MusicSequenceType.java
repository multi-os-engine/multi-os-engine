/**
 * [@enum] MusicSequenceType
 * 
 * A sequence type
 * 
 * Different sequence types to describe the basic mode of operation of a sequence's time line
 * You cannot change a music sequence's type to samples/seconds if there are tempo events
 * The type will also define how the sequence is saved to a MIDI file:
 * Beats - normal midi file
 * Seconds - midi file with SMPTE time
 * Samples - cannot be saved to a midi file
 * [@constant] kMusicSequenceType_Beats
 * The default/normal type of a sequence.
 * Tempo track defines the number of beats per second and can have multiple tempo events
 * [@constant] kMusicSequenceType_Seconds
 * A music sequence with a single 60bpm tempo event
 * [@constant] kMusicSequenceType_Samples
 * A music sequence with a single tempo event that represents the audio sample rate
