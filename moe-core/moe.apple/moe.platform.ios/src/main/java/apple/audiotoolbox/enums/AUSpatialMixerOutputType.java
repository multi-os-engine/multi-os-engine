 * [@constant] kSpatialMixerOutputType_Headphones
 * 
 * Render for headphones.
 * 
 * [@constant] kSpatialMixerOutputType_BuiltInSpeakers
 * 
 * Render for built-in speakers. The spatialization is optimized for current hardware and
 * will not be suitable for playback on other hardware. On iOS devices, the rendering may
 * be specific to device orientation. Non-realtime rendering may not provide intended results
 * if the orientation changes between rendering the audio and playing it back.
 * 
 * [@constant] kSpatialMixerOutputType_ExternalSpeakers
 * 
 * Render for external speakers based on the mixer's output channel layout.
