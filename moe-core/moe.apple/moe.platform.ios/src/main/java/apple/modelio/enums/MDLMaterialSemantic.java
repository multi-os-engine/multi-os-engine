/**
 * MDLMaterialSemantic
 * 
 * [@summary] The material semantics are identifiers for material properties
 * formally identified by one of the standard material descriptors.
 * 
 * When files containing material properties are loaded and translated
 * by ModelIO, an appropriate standard material descriptor will be
 * chosen, and any properties translated from the loaded file can be
 * retrieved using one of these semantics.
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticBaseColor
 * The inherent color of a surface to be used as a modulator during shading.
 * Default is 50% gray
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticSubsurface,
 * The degree to which light scatters under the surface of a material
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticMetallic
 * A blend between a material behaving as a dielectric material at zero, and a
 * metal at one.
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticSpecular
 * Specular response to incident light
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticSpecularExponent
 * Power of the specular exponent in the case that a Blinn/Phong BSDF is in use.
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticSpecularTint
 * At zero, the specular highlight will use the hue, saturation, and intensity
 * of incoming light to color the specular response; at one, the material's
 * base color, and the light's intensity will be used.
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticRoughness
 * Controls diffuse and specular response. A value of zero is smooth and shiny.
 * At one, a diffuse material will retroreflect, and the specular highlight
 * will be very spread out.
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticAnisotropic
 * The degree to which the specular highlight is elongated in the direction of
 * the local tangent basis. A mesh that does not have a tangent basis will not
 * respond to this parameter.
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticAnisotropicRotation
 * The degree to which the anisotropy is rotated relative to the direction of the
 * local tangent basis. Values from zero to one are mapped to zero to two PI.
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticSheen
 * A specular tint that appears at glancing angles on an object
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticSheenTint
 * At zero, the specular highlight will use the hue, saturation, and intensity
 * of incoming light to color the specular response; at one, the material's
 * base color, and the light's intensity will be used.
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticClearcoat
 * A second specular highlight, much like the gloss that results from a clear
 * coat on an automotive finish
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticClearcoatGloss
 * The glossiness of the clear coat highlight.
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticEmission
 * A value that is to be emitted as radiance by a surface
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticBump
 * A value that perturbs surface normals according to the local gradient of
 * the property
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticOpacity
 * The opacity of the surface
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticInterfaceIndexOfRefraction
 * n1 in Schlick's equation, typically 1.0 for air
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticMaterialIndexOfRefraction
 * n2 in Schlick's equation
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticObjectSpaceNormal
 * A value that perturbs surface normals in object space
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticTangentSpaceNormal
 * A value that perturbs surface normals in a local tangent space
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticDisplacement
 * Displacement of a surface relative to surface normal
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticDisplacementScale
 * Scaling factor for displacement
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticAmbientOcclusion
 * Ambient occlusion describes the accessibility of the surface to the
 * surrounding radiant environment and is typically used to attenuate it. It is
 * not intended to attenuate direct illumination sources.
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticAmbientOcclusionScale
 * The degree to which the ambient occlusion values are applied
 * 
 * MDLMaterialSemanticUserDefined = 0x8000
 * Properties with this value are created when material properties are
 * translated for which no known semantic applies.
 * Semantics defined at greater than this value are available to be user defined.
 * The first value is also used to indicate
