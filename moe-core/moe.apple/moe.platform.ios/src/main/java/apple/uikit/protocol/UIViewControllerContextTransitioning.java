/**
 * A transition context object is constructed by the system and passed to the
 * animator in its animateTransition: and transitionDuration: methods as well as
 * to the interaction controller in its startInteractiveTransition: method. If
 * there is an interaction controller its startInteractiveTransition: is called
 * first and its up to the the interaction controller object to call the
 * animateTransition: method if needed. If there is no interaction controller,
 * then the system automatically invokes the animator's animateTransition:
 * method.
 * 
 * The system queries the view controller's transitioningDelegate or the
 * navigation controller's delegate to determine if an animator or interaction
 * controller should be used in a transition. The transitioningDelegate is a new
 * property on UIViewController and conforms to the
 * UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate protocol defined below. The navigation
 * controller likewise has been augmented with a couple of new delegate methods.
 * 
 * The UIViewControllerContextTransitioning protocol can be adopted by custom
 * container controllers. It is purposely general to cover more complex
 * transitions than the system currently supports. For now, navigation push/pops
 * and UIViewController present/dismiss transitions can be
 * customized. Information about the transition is obtained by using the
 * viewControllerForKey:, initialFrameForViewController:, and
 * finalFrameForViewController: methods. The system provides two keys for
 * identifying the from view controller and the to view controller for
 * navigation push/pop and view controller present/dismiss transitions.
 * 
 * All custom animations must invoke the context's completeTransition: method
 * when the transition completes. Furthermore the animation should take place
 * within the containerView specified by the context. For interactive
 * transitions the context's updateInteractiveTransition:,
 * finishInteractiveTransition or cancelInteractiveTransition should be called
 * as the interactive animation proceeds. The UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition
 * class provides an implementation of the UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning
 * protocol that can be used to interactively drive any UIView property animations
 * that are created by an animator.
