/**
 * [@protocol] NSURLConnectionDataDelegate
 * 
 * Delegate methods used for loading data to memory.
 * These delegate methods are all optional.
 * 
 * connection:willSendRequest:redirectResponse: is
 * called whenever an connection determines that it
 * must change URLs in order to continue loading a
 * request. This gives the delegate an opportunity
 * inspect and if necessary modify a request. A
 * delegate can cause the request to abort by either
 * calling the connections -cancel method, or by
 * returning nil from this callback.<p>
 * 
 * There is one subtle difference which results from
 * this choice. If -cancel is called in the delegate
 * method, all processing for the connection stops,
 * and no further delegate callbacks will be sent. If
 * the delegate returns nil, the connection will
 * continue to process, and this has special
 * relevance in the case where the redirectResponse
 * argument is non-nil. In this case, any data that
 * is loaded for the connection will be sent to the
 * delegate, and the delegate will receive a finished
 * or failure delegate callback as appropriate.<p>
 * 
 * connection:didReceiveResponse: is called when
 * enough data has been read to construct an
 * NSURLResponse object. In the event of a protocol
 * which may return multiple responses (such as HTTP
 * multipart/x-mixed-replace) the delegate should be
 * prepared to inspect the new response and make
 * itself ready for data callbacks as appropriate.<p>
 * 
 * connection:didReceiveData: is called with a single
 * immutable NSData object to the delegate,
 * representing the next portion of the data loaded
 * from the connection. This is the only guaranteed
 * for the delegate to receive the data from the
 * resource load.<p>
 * 
 * connection:needNewBodyStream: is called when the
 * loader must retransmit a requests payload, due to
 * connection errors or authentication challenges.
 * Delegates should construct a new unopened and
 * autoreleased NSInputStream. If not implemented,
 * the loader will be required to spool the bytes to
 * be uploaded to disk, a potentially expensive
 * operation. Returning nil will cancel the
 * connection.
 * 
 * connection:didSendBodyData:totalBytesWritten:totalBytesExpectedToWrite:
 * is called during an upload operation to provide
 * progress feedback. Note that the values may
 * change in unexpected ways if the request needs to
 * be retransmitted.<p>
 * 
 * connection:willCacheResponse: gives the delegate
 * an opportunity to inspect and modify the
 * NSCachedURLResponse which will be cached by the
 * loader if caching is enabled for the original
 * NSURLRequest. Returning nil from this delegate
 * will prevent the resource from being cached. Note
 * that the -data method of the cached response may
 * return an autoreleased in-memory copy of the true
 * data, and should not be used as an alternative to
 * receiving and accumulating the data through
 * connection:didReceiveData:<p>
 * 
 * connectionDidFinishLoading: is called when all
 * connection processing has completed successfully,
 * before the delegate is released by the
 * connection.<p>
 * 
 * API-Since: 2.0
