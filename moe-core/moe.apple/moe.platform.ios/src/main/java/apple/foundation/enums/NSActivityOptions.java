/**
 * The system has heuristics to improve battery life, performance, and responsiveness of applications for the benefit of
 * the user. This API can be used to give hints to the system that your application has special requirements. In
 * response to creating one of these activities, the system will disable some or all of the heuristics so your
 * application can finish quickly while still providing responsive behavior if the user needs it.
 * 
 * These activities can be used when your application is performing a long-running operation. If the activity can take
 * different amounts of time (for example, calculating the next move in a chess game), it should use this API. This will
 * ensure correct behavior when the amount of data or the capabilities of the user's computer varies. You should put
 * your activity into one of two major categories:
 * 
 * User initiated: These are finite length activities that the user has explicitly started. Examples include exporting
 * or downloading a user specified file.
 * 
 * Background: These are finite length activities that are part of the normal operation of your application but are not
 * explicitly started by the user. Examples include autosaving, indexing, and automatic downloading of files.
 * 
 * In addition, if your application requires high priority IO, you can include the 'NSActivityLatencyCritical' flag
 * (using a bitwise or). This should be reserved for activities like audio or video recording.
 * 
 * If your activity takes place synchronously inside an event callback on the main thread, you do not need to use this
 * API.
 * 
 * Be aware that failing to end these activities for an extended period of time can have significant negative impacts to
 * the performance of your user's computer, so be sure to use only the minimum amount of time required. User preferences
 * may override your applicationâ€™s request.
 * 
 * This API can also be used to control auto termination or sudden termination.
 * 
 * id activity = [NSProcessInfo.processInfo beginActivityWithOptions:NSActivityAutomaticTerminationDisabled
 * reason:@"Good Reason"];
 * // work
 * [NSProcessInfo.processInfo endActivity:activity];
 * 
 * is equivalent to:
 * 
 * [NSProcessInfo.processInfo disableAutomaticTermination:@"Good Reason"];
 * // work
 * [NSProcessInfo.processInfo enableAutomaticTermination:@"Good Reason"]
 * 
 * Since this API returns an object, it may be easier to pair begins and ends. If the object is deallocated before the
 * -endActivity: call, the activity will be automatically ended.
 * 
 * This API also provides a mechanism to disable system-wide idle sleep and display idle sleep. These can have a large
 * impact on the user experience, so be sure not to forget to end activities that disable sleep (including
 * NSActivityUserInitiated).
 * 
 * 
 * API-Since: 7.0
